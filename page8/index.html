				<p>It&#39;s quite easy to have multiple versions of rails installed as gems when working with ruby on rails.  Quite frequently, you will be working on a project that uses an older version of rails than one on your machine, and all you have to do to get the correct version is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-terminal" data-lang="terminal">$ gem install -v 1.2.3 rails --include-dependencies
</code></pre></div>
<p>Multiple versions of rails can exist independently on your machine without much of a problem.  Since your individual rails projects store the version number they expect, and your projects don&#39;t tend to depend on each other, you can have hundreds of different rails versions installed and never notice. Mostly.</p>

<p>If, however, you wish to start a NEW project, when you run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-terminal" data-lang="terminal">$ rails projectname
</code></pre></div>
<p>It will use the most recent version of rails.  But what if, for some reason, you have rails 2.0.1 and rails 1.2.6 on your machine, and wish to generate a rails 1.2.6 application?  This came up because I&#39;m trying to teach a friend rails, and the book he has is for rails 1.2, meaning that if he uses 2.0 all of the scaffolding code (as well as other bits) from the book are incorrect.  At the same time, the application he and I are working on together uses rails 2.0, so he needs both versions on his machine.</p>

				<p>One of the nicest things about Ruby is how well it supports metaprogramming.  You can dynamically, at runtime, change the behavior of any other class or module in the system, even private methods.  </p>

<p>When I was first learning Ruby, this seemed like a flaw, and while I still feel that this ability can be abused, it is definitely handy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to explain a simple method of changing the behavior of part of Rails by a real-life example from work.</p>

<p>For a Ruby on Rails project I&#39;m currently working on, we had a somewhat uncommon requirement.  We&#39;re dealing with a lot of data, which we store for other companies.  For various reasons, one of the concerns is that we may be subpoenaed and forced to provide all of our records for legal reasons.  In order to fully protect the identities of our customers, our system was designed around never actually storing any identifying information about our customers.  Instead, customers get a special code that identifies them, and we only have the ability to know the code, but we can&#39;t tie the code to any specific organization.  This may seem like a strange restriction, but for our application it was important.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m going to show you a little trick that will add two methods to any Java class, without actually defining them.  Furthermore, these methods will be given package visibility, accessible by any class in the same package. </p>

<p>First and foremost, credit for showing me this interesting <code>javac</code> tidbit goes to <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a>.  Ted recently presented an introduction to java bytecode at a local JUG.  The entire presentation was incredibly interesting, but one of the more interesting bits that came out was a little bit of trickery the java compiler performs in certain cases.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at two classes.   One we&#39;ll call CompTest, which will be a simple class that contains a private String and a method to print it to the screen.  The second will be CompExecutive, which will simply make a CompTest instance and call the one method it defines.  It will also use Java reflection to count the number of methods on CompTest.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">public class CompTest {
  private String myVariable=&quot;This is a private variable&quot;;

  public void printVar() {
    System.out.println(myVariable);
  }
}
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">import java.lang.reflect.*;

public class CompExecutive {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CompTest ct=new CompTest();
    ct.printVar();

    //Get all of the methods on the class.
    Method[] declaredMethods=ct.getClass().getDeclaredMethods();
    System.out.println(&quot;Number of Methods on CompTest: &quot;+declaredMethods.length);
  }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>When we run this program, we get what we would expect.  The outputted string, as well as the number of methods defined in CompTest, one.</p>

				<p>For the past two months, I&#39;ve been learning three different programming languages simultaneously.  I&#39;ve been wanting to learn Python for a while, and I finally made some time to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Second-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596002815">Learning Python</a> cover to cover on camping trips.  I&#39;ve also been thrown into the world of Ruby (as well as Rails) for work, since we are developing our next web application using that technology.  Lastly, I&#39;ve had to learn C# and .NET for school - the last class for my Master&#39;s degree.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve wanted to learn all three of these technologies for a while, but I&#39;ve never had the time.  This has been a very exciting experience for me, and I wanted to share my first impressions of these languages.</p>

<h1>C#: First Impressions</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been working with C# less than the other languages, so I still have a great deal to learn.  Overall, the experience has been pretty positive.  The language is almost exactly like Java.  Java stole it&#39;s syntax from C for the most part (for developer familiarity), but C# is sort of a syntactic hybrid between Java and C++ (more towards the Java side).  Overall, I like it.  </p>

<p>I used to use C++ in high school and C in college.  I never really liked C++ - I felt like the language hacked object orientation onto a fully procedural language, and it really showed.  The language never seemed well designed to me, and it kind of had a &quot;worst of both worlds&quot; feel to it.  C# seems like a natural progression in the C family - something even higher level than C++, without the procedural vestiges of C.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been a lifelong Windows user.  The first computer I ever had ran Windows 3.1 and I eagerly upgraded to Windows 95, 98, and 2000.  I considered myself a power user of these operating systems.  Yes, I ran Windows, but I also developed in Windows frequently, and I understood Windows at an accomplished level.</p>

<p>Though I&#39;ve been an Open-Source advocate for quite some time, I frequently experienced major problems when trying out Linux.  </p>

<p>I tried a version of RedHat when I was in high school, and I tried Mandrake, Gentoo, and Fedora when I was in college. Whenever I tried to use Linux, I was met with some kind of problem that I couldn&#39;t overcome by myself.  A &quot;deal-breaker&quot;, as I called it, that left me to transition back to Windows with frustration.</p>

<p>I lived on the Computer Interest Floor when I was in college, and a lot of my friends ran Linux, so I figured it would be a great time to evaluate Linux.  I tried many times to run Linux with the help of these friends, but even they, as Linux Gurus, discovered my problems couldn&#39;t be overcome.  I used my computer for everything - work, school, multimedia, and even television.  Not being able to do my job (which was writing Flash applications) was a dealbreaker one year.  Not being able to use my tv-card in Linux was a dealbreaker another year.</p>

				<p>Right after I graduated, I decided I needed a change of scenery and decided to move from New York to Colorado.  I assumed that a Computer Science degree would get me a job pretty quickly after I graduated, so I thought nothing of driving across the country with no job lined up.  I figured I could move into an apartment and find a job in a few weeks.  What I discovered was that my lack of experience was a major problem for most companies.  My previous job had been working for a small company being run by a professor.  He recruited me into his company when he saw one of my projects for his class.  They were tiny.  We had our company meetings in coffee shops around campus.  I did all of my work in my own dorm room.</p>

<p>It became apparent that I lacked a great deal of real-world industry programming experience.  I definitely needed to be molded, and all of the companies who saw my resume seemed to realize that.  </p>

<p>I applied for a ton of jobs, and only heard back from one.  I bought a suit the day before my interview, the only suit I had owned since I bought one for a funeral when I was a teenager.</p>

<h1>My First Interview</h1>

<table class='image alignright' width='306'><tr><td><img src='/assets/company1.thumbnail.jpg' width='300' height='225'/></td></tr></table>

<p>The company was in Denver.  I drove into the city (for the first time since I moved to Colorado) and looked for the office.  The buildings seemed to skip over the address I had written.  Eventually I discovered that I had to walk between two buildings, into the side entrance to the basement of one of them.  No logo was on the door, so I knocked, terrified at what might open the door.  A woman opened, told me I was at the right place, and invited me in.  Once I stepped inside, I was asked to take my shoes off, so I didn&#39;t track dirt onto the rug.  While I sat in the &quot;waiting area&quot; a guy came out from an adjacent room and fiddled with a cable modem plugged in behind me.  The &quot;company&quot; consisted of 3 people, including the receptionist.  Once my &quot;interview&quot; began, I was asked to write some code in JSP.  I had explained in my cover letter that I didn&#39;t know anything about JSP, but I&#39;ve used Java and I&#39;d be happy to learn JSP.  He told me to write the code anyway.  &quot;Figure it out.&quot;</p>

				<p>I bought a Western Digital NetCenter drive in anticipation of switching to Linux not too long ago (wanted a place for multimedia).  While Windows had no problem using the shares I set up on the drive, getting it to work in Linux has been a nightmare.  After a lot of failed discussions in #ubuntu on the IRC Server, as well as a post on the Ubuntu Forum that went unanswered for a month, I figured out the problems and decided to post my own tutorial so that poor schmoes like me searching for NetCenter-specific information could find it.</p>

<p>Before I go through this, you&#39;ll need to see if my goal with the NetCenter is close to your own.  Basically, I wanted a place for multimedia on the network, such as mp3s and the like.  I wanted to be able to still download stuff using my Linux machine (my main Desktop computer), but then move stuff to the network drive.  This meant that I wanted a simple directory somewhere within Linux that behaved as though I had all of my multimedia on the machine itself.  In Windows, I&#39;d map my MP3 Share to the Z: drive, so my mp3s were always at Z:.  I wanted it to be similarly simple in Linux.</p>

<h1>Preparing the Shares</h1>

<p>Step one is to enable NFS on your shares.  When you make a share in the NetCenter web admin tool, you must make sure that, for the security settings for your folder, you enable NFS.</p>

<p>I believe the NetCenter comes with some kind of Windows-centric application to manage shares, but I didn&#39;t bother with that.  Once you find out your NetCenter&#39;s ip address, you can simply load that IP in your web browser and find the web admin tool.  Make your shares through that.</p>

				<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/3/how_i_blew_my_interview_with_google">this site</a> (talking about the ways in which people blew their Google interviews) links to me.  They highlighted my mention of the guy with the thick accent, implying I blew the interview by not understanding him. I&#39;d like to clarify, that part of the experience was just a relevant part of the story, which is why I shared it.  I blew the Google Interview not for that reason, but because my algorithm skills simply were not up to snuff at the time.  Blaming the rejection on having a hard time with accents would be petty and silly.  I was rejected because I wasn&#39;t good enough, plain and simple.</p>

<hr>

<p>Recently, I had the pleasure of interviewing with Google.  It was very exciting, as I&#39;ve wanted to work for Google for quite some time, and they opened up a branch near my home through an acquisition recently.  I wanted to share the process of interviewing with Google, not because it was particularly noteworthy, but because I wondered about interviewing with Google before I did so, and I figured others might.  I&#39;ve had to sign an NDA, so I&#39;m going to be pretty careful about what I share in this post.</p>

<table class='image alignright' width='306'><tr><td><img src='/assets/dsc00055_t.jpg' width='300' height='211'/><p class='caption'>Me, excited</p></td></tr></table>

<p>The position I interviewed for was a Software Engineer position in the Boulder, Colorado office (near where I live), but they still conduct their interviews from the California office.  Because I&#39;m not in California, I had to go through two phone interviews first.  The questions Google asks are pretty interesting for a number of reasons.  I think the best word I could use to describe the questions is &quot;fair&quot;.  I didn&#39;t get any tricky puzzle questions.  Nobody asked me what I would do if I were shrunk to the size of a nickel and thrown in a blender.  Not a single question was an &quot;a-ha!&quot; type brain-teaser.  Pretty much every question was a good question for figuring out if someone can write code.  Even though I was interviewing for a Java position, I only had one Java-specific question.  I could really feel from the questions that Google wasn&#39;t concerned with me being good with a specific language; they really wanted to know if I was just a good coder.</p>

<p>When I was first told by the recruiter that the questions would be algorithm-based, I was worried I&#39;d have to reproduce quicksort or something.  In fact, the questions were far, far more reasonable (though reviewing sorting algorithms WAS a good idea).  Most of them involved manipulating data in an array for some purpose.  I&#39;d give an answer that worked, and they&#39;d ask me if there were any corner cases.  I was asked to solve the problem in a way that avoided those problems.  Then I was asked to improve the space efficiency or running efficiency of the solution.  A solution that &quot;worked&quot; was never enough, the interviewers always pushed me further, trying to squeeze out performance.  I had to say the runtime complexity for nearly every solution I suggested.  I would NOT recommend interviewing with Google without a Computer Science degree.  You need to be able to look at a function and know the Big-O for it immediately. Specifically, you need to look at YOUR OWN functions and know the Big-O immediately.</p></hr>

				<p>Neil asks on his blog, &quot;<a href="http://blog.feed-squirrel.com/2006/12/07/what-is-it-with-the-coldfusion-compiler/"> What is it with the Coldfusion Compiler?</a>&quot;</p>

<p>Essentially, he posts a simple piece of code in CF that counts up to 1000000 in a loop, then prints out how long that takes.  He does the same thing in JSP, and times that as well.  The JSP code executes much, much more quickly than the CF code, and he wants to know why.  The reason for the interest is that ColdFusion compiles to Java, and one of the big selling points is that CF is just another way of writing Java web code, since it all gets compiled to servlets anyway.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why the CF code is slower.  First and foremost, he&#39;s using a scriptlet in the JSP.  This compiles directly, character for character, to the .java file that gets compiled into a class.  The CF code is using tags.  I think a more fair comparison would be to use JSTL and write a scriptless JSP to do the same thing, however I&#39;m quite confident the JSP code will still come out way ahead.</p>

<p>The real reasons for the difference are actually quite interesting, and I&#39;ll take you through my process of experimentation as I set out to figure out the exact answer. </p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been studying for a while for the Sun Certified Web Component Developer exam, and I just finished the test a little ago with a passing score (a pretty good one, too).</p>

<p>This exam was very interesting for me.  I decided after I completed my Sun Certified Java Programmer certification that the next one I wanted to tackle was the web cert.  It was different, though, because I had been programming in Java for some time before taking the JP exam, whereas I had never written a Servlet or JSP file in my life when I decided to pursue the SCWCD path.</p>

<p>The reason I decided to study for an exam rather than simply read a book on the material was quite simple: it forces me to learn EVERYTHING about the topic.  Generally when I learn something new, I learn by example and experimentation.  This makes me a quick and eager learner, but the end result is what I call &quot;swiss cheese knowledge.&quot;  I know a lot, but there are gaping holes in my understanding of the topic, and usually I don&#39;t even know they exist.  Before I took the SCJP exam, I thought I was a Java guru.  Only by studying the material and practicing for the exam did I come to see the many gaps in my knowledge.  The process both alerted me to the existence of the gaps, as well as filled them in.  The SCJP exam was very valuable for me.  Not just because it makes my resume looks nice, or because Sun sent me a snazzy lapel pin, but because the process involved in preparing for the exam made me a far, far greater Java developer.  The test itself isn&#39;t all that important for the process, other than to tell me that I correctly filled in most of the gaps.</p>

<p>Thus, when I realized I wanted to learn about Servlet and JSP technolgy, I decided that the best way to learn the material deeply was by preparing for the SCWCD exam.</p>
