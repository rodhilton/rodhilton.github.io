				<p>Right after I graduated, I decided I needed a change of scenery and decided to move from New York to Colorado.  I assumed that a Computer Science degree would get me a job pretty quickly after I graduated, so I thought nothing of driving across the country with no job lined up.  I figured I could move into an apartment and find a job in a few weeks.  What I discovered was that my lack of experience was a major problem for most companies.  My previous job had been working for a small company being run by a professor.  He recruited me into his company when he saw one of my projects for his class.  They were tiny.  We had our company meetings in coffee shops around campus.  I did all of my work in my own dorm room.</p><p>It became apparent that I lacked a great deal of real-world industry programming experience.  I definitely needed to be molded, and all of the companies who saw my resume seemed to realize that.  </p><p>I applied for a ton of jobs, and only heard back from one.  I bought a suit the day before my interview, the only suit I had owned since I bought one for a funeral when I was a teenager.</p><p>The company was in Denver.  I drove into the city (for the first time since I moved to Colorado) and looked for the office.  The buildings seemed to skip over the address I had written.  Eventually I discovered that I had to walk between two buildings, into the side entrance to the basement of one of them.  No logo was on the door, so I knocked, terrified at what might open the door.  A woman opened, told me I was at the right place, and invited me in.  Once I stepped inside, I was asked to take my shoes off, so I didn&#39;t track dirt onto the rug.  While I sat in the &quot;waiting area&quot; a guy came out from an adjacent room and fiddled with a cable modem plugged in behind me.  The &quot;company&quot; consisted of 3 people, including the receptionist.  Once my &quot;interview&quot; began, I was asked to write some code in JSP.  I had explained in my cover letter that I didn&#39;t know anything about JSP, but I&#39;ve used Java and I&#39;d be happy to learn JSP.  He told me to write the code anyway.  &quot;Figure it out.&quot;</p>

				<p>I bought a Western Digital NetCenter drive in anticipation of switching to Linux not too long ago (wanted a place for multimedia).  While Windows had no problem using the shares I set up on the drive, getting it to work in Linux has been a nightmare.  After a lot of failed discussions in #ubuntu on the IRC Server, as well as a post on the Ubuntu Forum that went unanswered for a month, I figured out the problems and decided to post my own tutorial so that poor schmoes like me searching for NetCenter-specific information could find it.</p><p>Before I go through this, you&#39;ll need to see if my goal with the NetCenter is close to your own.  Basically, I wanted a place for multimedia on the network, such as mp3s and the like.  I wanted to be able to still download stuff using my Linux machine (my main Desktop computer), but then move stuff to the network drive.  This meant that I wanted a simple directory somewhere within Linux that behaved as though I had all of my multimedia on the machine itself.  In Windows, I&#39;d map my MP3 Share to the Z: drive, so my mp3s were always at Z:.  I wanted it to be similarly simple in Linux.</p><p>Step one is to enable NFS on your shares.  When you make a share in the NetCenter web admin tool, you must make sure that, for the security settings for your folder, you enable NFS.</p><p>I believe the NetCenter comes with some kind of Windows-centric application to manage shares, but I didn&#39;t bother with that.  Once you find out your NetCenter&#39;s ip address, you can simply load that IP in your web browser and find the web admin tool.  Make your shares through that.</p>

				<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/3/how_i_blew_my_interview_with_google">this site</a> (talking about the ways in which people blew their Google interviews) links to me.  They highlighted my mention of the guy with the thick accent, implying I blew the interview by not understanding him. I&#39;d like to clarify, that part of the experience was just a relevant part of the story, which is why I shared it.  I blew the Google Interview not for that reason, but because my algorithm skills simply were not up to snuff at the time.  Blaming the rejection on having a hard time with accents would be petty and silly.  I was rejected because I wasn&#39;t good enough, plain and simple.</p><p>Recently, I had the pleasure of interviewing with Google.  It was very exciting, as I&#39;ve wanted to work for Google for quite some time, and they opened up a branch near my home through an acquisition recently.  I wanted to share the process of interviewing with Google, not because it was particularly noteworthy, but because I wondered about interviewing with Google before I did so, and I figured others might.  I&#39;ve had to sign an NDA, so I&#39;m going to be pretty careful about what I share in this post.</p><p>The position I interviewed for was a Software Engineer position in the Boulder, Colorado office (near where I live), but they still conduct their interviews from the California office.  Because I&#39;m not in California, I had to go through two phone interviews first.  The questions Google asks are pretty interesting for a number of reasons.  I think the best word I could use to describe the questions is &quot;fair&quot;.  I didn&#39;t get any tricky puzzle questions.  Nobody asked me what I would do if I were shrunk to the size of a nickel and thrown in a blender.  Not a single question was an &quot;a-ha!&quot; type brain-teaser.  Pretty much every question was a good question for figuring out if someone can write code.  Even though I was interviewing for a Java position, I only had one Java-specific question.  I could really feel from the questions that Google wasn&#39;t concerned with me being good with a specific language; they really wanted to know if I was just a good coder.</p><p>When I was first told by the recruiter that the questions would be algorithm-based, I was worried I&#39;d have to reproduce quicksort or something.  In fact, the questions were far, far more reasonable (though reviewing sorting algorithms WAS a good idea).  Most of them involved manipulating data in an array for some purpose.  I&#39;d give an answer that worked, and they&#39;d ask me if there were any corner cases.  I was asked to solve the problem in a way that avoided those problems.  Then I was asked to improve the space efficiency or running efficiency of the solution.  A solution that &quot;worked&quot; was never enough, the interviewers always pushed me further, trying to squeeze out performance.  I had to say the runtime complexity for nearly every solution I suggested.  I would NOT recommend interviewing with Google without a Computer Science degree.  You need to be able to look at a function and know the Big-O for it immediately. Specifically, you need to look at YOUR OWN functions and know the Big-O immediately.</p>

				<p>Neil asks on his blog, &quot;<a href="http://blog.feed-squirrel.com/2006/12/07/what-is-it-with-the-coldfusion-compiler/"> What is it with the Coldfusion Compiler?</a>&quot;</p><p>Essentially, he posts a simple piece of code in CF that counts up to 1000000 in a loop, then prints out how long that takes.  He does the same thing in JSP, and times that as well.  The JSP code executes much, much more quickly than the CF code, and he wants to know why.  The reason for the interest is that ColdFusion compiles to Java, and one of the big selling points is that CF is just another way of writing Java web code, since it all gets compiled to servlets anyway.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why the CF code is slower.  First and foremost, he&#39;s using a scriptlet in the JSP.  This compiles directly, character for character, to the .java file that gets compiled into a class.  The CF code is using tags.  I think a more fair comparison would be to use JSTL and write a scriptless JSP to do the same thing, however I&#39;m quite confident the JSP code will still come out way ahead.</p><p>The real reasons for the difference are actually quite interesting, and I&#39;ll take you through my process of experimentation as I set out to figure out the exact answer. </p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been studying for a while for the Sun Certified Web Component Developer exam, and I just finished the test a little ago with a passing score (a pretty good one, too).</p><p>This exam was very interesting for me.  I decided after I completed my Sun Certified Java Programmer certification that the next one I wanted to tackle was the web cert.  It was different, though, because I had been programming in Java for some time before taking the JP exam, whereas I had never written a Servlet or JSP file in my life when I decided to pursue the SCWCD path.</p><p>The reason I decided to study for an exam rather than simply read a book on the material was quite simple: it forces me to learn EVERYTHING about the topic.  Generally when I learn something new, I learn by example and experimentation.  This makes me a quick and eager learner, but the end result is what I call &quot;swiss cheese knowledge.&quot;  I know a lot, but there are gaping holes in my understanding of the topic, and usually I don&#39;t even know they exist.  Before I took the SCJP exam, I thought I was a Java guru.  Only by studying the material and practicing for the exam did I come to see the many gaps in my knowledge.  The process both alerted me to the existence of the gaps, as well as filled them in.  The SCJP exam was very valuable for me.  Not just because it makes my resume looks nice, or because Sun sent me a snazzy lapel pin, but because the process involved in preparing for the exam made me a far, far greater Java developer.  The test itself isn&#39;t all that important for the process, other than to tell me that I correctly filled in most of the gaps.</p><p>Thus, when I realized I wanted to learn about Servlet and JSP technolgy, I decided that the best way to learn the material deeply was by preparing for the SCWCD exam.</p>

				<p>Ever since Java 5 came out, many articles and blog posts have been written talking about the new features.  Just recently, however, I came upon a feature new to Java 5 that I had never seen mentioned in any of the articles I read: global exception handling.</p><p>There is a way to set a default handler for any exceptions that are thrown which are not caught.  This is very handy for adding handlers for <code>RuntimeException</code>s, since they are unchecked and the compiler will not tell you to catch them.</p><p>For example, you may want to write a handler that will catch any <code>NullPointerException</code>, and e-mail the development team to let them know someone has made a coding mistake.  There are many useful purposes for this feature.  It should also be noted, however, that it breaks the idea of capturing an exception as close to the point of origin as possible.  You should try to keep exception handling close to the exception, so that you have as much contextual information as possible to deal with the error and recover from it gracefully.</p><p>There is no denying, though, that we all write empty catch blocks, or catch blocks that print a trace to a log file and ignore it.  For those, this is handy.</p>

The problem is, when I have to change my password monthly, I can&#39;t use the handful of secure passwords I memorized long ago because I don&#39;t have that many, and thus I am forced to pick passwords that I can remember (which makes them more breakable) or write them down and keep them with me (which is better, but still has flaws).</p><p>Because I dislike both options, I devised a system that allows me to maintain a monthly-changing password, without having to write it down where someone can find it, and without having to make my password weaker so that I can memorize it.</p><p>I will describe this system and post some usable source code in this post.

				<p>A number of prominent software developers have written essays and blog postings explaining how important it is to embrace new technologies, encourage developers of &#39;fringe&#39; languages, and the like.  There are a number of articles that I&#39;m too lazy to look up that make these assertions and similar ones.  Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html">one</a>.  Here&#39;s <a href="http://halhelms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsletters.show&amp;issue=feb2006">another</a>. It is extremely common for people to argue that the most important thing when developing software is to use the right tool for the job; if Python is the best language for a task, then use it instead of a more popular language.  This is true to a very large degree, but this viewpoint misses a crucial practical aspect to software development.</p><p>&quot;Right tool for the job&quot; is an idealogical stance, one I happen to strongly agree with, but as with all idealogical stances, it frequently is at odds with practical considerations which require compromising the ideal.  When tasked with new development, the most natural view is to figure out what tools and languages are needed, then use them.  This attitude, however, is somewhat shortsighted.  A product spends far more time in maintenance mode than in original development, and the people who tend to maintain the applications are rarely the original developers for the lifetime of the product.  That means that whoever maintains the code has to understand it well enough to make changes and, as a result, the person who is hired to take that role must be familiar with the tools and languages used to develop it.</p><p>So it&#39;s very possible that when you hire a Python or Lisp programmer, you get &#39;better&#39; programmers because if someone uses a fringe language, they are likely to do so because they are passionate about it, which makes them a better programmer than your average paycheck monkey.  Indeed, a lot of people out there seeking and getting Java or .NET jobs are merely people who know the language well enough to collect a paycheck, and they aren&#39;t passionate about the language or software development in general. The argument that someone seeking a Python job is more passionate DOES hold a lot of water (even though there are many passionate Java and .NET developers), because paycheck monkeys are unlikely to learn Python, Lisp, or Ruby: they&#39;re going to learn what they need to give themselves the most opportunity.</p><p>The problem arises when that original passionate developer retires, moves up in the company, leaves the company, gets hit by a bus, or avoids being hit by a bus due to a last-second premonition that causes Death to go after him/her as well as a group of sexy teenagers that also avoided being hit by the bus and created an imbalance that must be corrected using a series of complex deadly Rube Goldberg machines.  The point is, when someone has to take the project over, if the project is written in a fringe language by a passionate person, it becomes extremely difficult to find a good candidate.</p>

				<p>At work, when we log onto the system, we are greeted with a message about how our company is free to monitor our network usage and so forth.  The bottom tells us that &quot;By Clicking OK&quot; we are agreeing to the terms.  The only button available to click, of course, is an &quot;OK&quot; button.  </p><p>A co-worker realized, however, he could get rid of the box by pressing escape rather than clicking &quot;OK&quot;, and that this meant he was not agreeing to the terms but still able to access the system.</p><p>This led to a discussion about the Windows API.  My contention was that the way the windows API MessageBox works, pressing escape returns the same value as pressing OK.  </p><p>The way the function works, you basically call the MessageBox function provided by Windows.  You give it a windows handle (more on that in a second), a string containing the message box text, another string containing the caption (like a window title), and an integer that represents the TYPE of message box.  Types can be &quot;OK Button Only&quot; or &quot;Yes Button and No Button&quot; or &quot;Abort, Retry, Ignore&quot; or a handful of other types.  The application calls this function, and windows makes a message box pop up.  Where it pops up is based on the windows handle you provide and what buttons it has result from the fourth parameter, which can also supply which icon is presented, like the Stop icon or the Warning icon.  The application pauses and waits for a response - and when the user clicks a button, the function returns the value for that button to the application.  Presumably, the application will then check the result and decide what course of action to take.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been trying to figure out for a while now how to get the IP address of a user consuming an Axis web service.  Finally figured it out today.</p><p>The class used by the service doesn&#39;t extend anything in Axis, and Axis invokes the methods on the class through reflection, so there didn&#39;t seem to be an obvious way to get an IP address - in fact, the class had no concept of being involved with networking at all.</p><p>Well it turns out you can get a MessageContext for the &quot;current thread&quot; statically, and that context has properties which can be accessed by string keys, which are stored in a constants file.  Phew.</p><p>Be careful, though.  If you were making the object locally rather than through Axis (say, for testing),  getCurrentContext() will be null, so make sure you deal gracefully with that if you use this method.</p>
