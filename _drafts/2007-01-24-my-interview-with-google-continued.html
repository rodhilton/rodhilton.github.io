<p>I didn't expect the story of <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2006/12/30/my-interview-with-google/">My Interview With Google</a> to be a two-parter, but it turns out the story didn't end where I expected.</p>
<p>Not too long after I made the post, it was submitted to <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit.com</a> where it enjoyed front-page status for two days.  During that time, I got a lot of visitors and a lot of comments, some even from Google engineers.</p>
<p>I also got a private e-mail.  It was from someone at Google.  He explained that my post had been circulating around the Google office and when it got to him, it piqued his interest.</p>
<p>Essentially, he wanted me to come work for him in Mountain View.  He was looking for Java folks for his team, and he thought I'd be a good fit.  I jumped out of my chair when I read this, amazed some additional life had been breathed into my foray into the world of Google.  The more I considered the e-mail, however, the more a part of me wanted to say no.  Why?</p>
<p>His offer was essentially doing some semi-internal development for Google.  I wanted to work on their web application back-ends, so that was a tad disappointing.  Could that be the reason I wanted to turn him down?  That didn't seem right, I had been joking for a while that I'd be happy to clean toilets at Google.  Writing code is writing code.</p>
<p>The position was also contract-to-hire, which didn't roll my socks up and down.  But I had been saying that once I got my foot in the door, I'd be alright.  I knew I'd do fine at Google if I worked there, so I wasn't too concerned I wouldn't be hired permanently at the end of the contract work.  No, it wasn't the contract aspect that bothered me.</p>
<p>He also told me that I'd have to spend three months in California doing the job.  I'd then have to spend three months in California in a permanent position in order to "culturally integrate" before I could go back to Colorado and work in the Boulder office.  This definitely bothered me.  Since I would want to continue living in Colorado, I'd basically have to live in a hotel in California while Julia (my fiancee) stayed here in Colorado for 6 months.  I just got engaged a month ago, and the idea of abandoning the family I'm just starting for Google seemed completely unfair.  If I had gotten the job I originally interviewed for, I'd only have to be in CA for one week for training, so 6 months was a pretty big deal. When I told Julia, she told me that she could handle 6 months, and if I wanted to take this position I should.  She was completely supportive of whatever I wanted to do.  So it wasn't even the 6 months away from my home that was driving me to turn the position down.</p>
<p>I thought about this for days.  I couldn't figure out what about the offer I didn't like, so shouldn't I take it?  </p>
<p>Eventually I figured out what I didn't like about the situation and I turned it down.  I don't think I could explain my rationale better than I did in my e-mail to the guy from Google, so here is what I told him:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I've been thinking about your e-mail for a few days and I've finally made a decision.  This was not a decision I made lightly by any stretch.</p>
<p>Let me start out by saying thank you for e-mailing me and giving me another potential shot at Google.  I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to update my blog story with this additional bit, though I won't be using your name or any details.</p>
<p>As I said in e-mail and via the blog post, there is no place I'd rather work than Google.  Google, to me, is Mecca for software developers.  Google does amazing work that improves the entire world. There is no better way to put my software development skills to use than at Google, where I'd be doing good work to make life better for countless individuals.</p>
<p>My personality, my desire to learn, my goal of improving the world - all of these tell me that Google would be the best place I could work.  I know Google is right for me.</p>
<p>But am I right for Google?  The interview process concluded with a resounding "no".  Google decided that I am not a good fit for the company, and sent me back to Colorado. The fact that I made a funny blog post describing my journey doesn't change the fact that, from a technical standpoint, Google considers me below their standards.</p>
<p>Despite the conclusion of the interview, I believe I *AM* right for Google. I believe that, if I interview again after improving my algorithm skills and becoming more confident in my own abilities, Google will see that I am a good fit and hire me.</p>
<p>In short, I want to work at Google more than I can describe, but I want to work there because I earned it.  I want to start my first day at Google knowing that I belong there, and knowing that Google knows I belong there.</p>
<p>As tempting as your offer is, I feel like it's sneaking into Google via a backdoor. I want to enter Google through the front door.</p>
<p>I intend on improving my abilities and learning new skills, as I do all the time as a developer.  When I am ready, I will re-apply to Google, and hopefully I will meet you in the cafeteria during my week of training in California. :)</p>
<p>Thank you again for your e-mail.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I never imagined I would pass up a chance to work at Google, but there it is.  I think I very well may look back and regret this, but for the time-being I'm comfortable with my decision.</p>
<p>This, I imagine, actually concludes this story.  At least for a while.</p>
