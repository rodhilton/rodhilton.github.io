<p>the more interesting code is, the worse it is.  the best code is simple, straightforward, and does exactly what you expect.  the best classes are small, with well-named methods, a single responsibility.</p>
<p>the best code you've seen is not code you can recall.  any code you can recall is worse than code that just did its job.  if you can gloss over code without even thinking about it, its good</p>
