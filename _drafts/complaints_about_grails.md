i love grails, i think it's the best tech for building web apps, hands down.  the speed of development of ruby, with the scalability and 3rd party library support of java.  groovy lets you write java that's less verbose, or scala that's less strict with functional support.  groovy is awesome, grails is great.

but there are some things I hate.

 - filters are backwards
 - it's completely stupid and ridiculous that there's no way to have domain objects in /domain/ if they aren't persisted anywhere.
 - the location of filters is ugly
 - the 'magic' is not terribly well-documented
