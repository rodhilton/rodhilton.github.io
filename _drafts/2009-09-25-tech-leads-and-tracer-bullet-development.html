<p>A while back, I attended a talk by Jared Richardson, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Successful-Software-Projects/dp/0974514047">Ship It!</a>.  His talk essentially covered ways in which you could get a company that was having trouble delivering quality software back on track.  His talk contained a number of suggestions for what development teams could do to fix their development shop, and all of his material came from his book, "Ship It!".</p>
<p>At the time, the company I was working for was pretty broken in terms of process.  No QA, no defect tracking, no build server, no tests, no planning, no estimating.  Salespeople came into your cube and said "I just sold the ability to do X with the product, how soon could you have that up and running?"  Then I'd write some code and deploy it live to production without any other eyes looking at it.  Customer tries it out, calls salesperson if it doesn't work, salesperson tells me, I fix it, etc.  Quality was a problem as you might expect, and the developers spent most of their time fighting production fires.  I knew there was a better way, but I didn't know what it was.</p>
<p>Jared's talk explained that better way, and it focused not on adopting a specific process (which often can have difficulty getting buy-in from management or other team members) like Scrum, but on making small but important changes.  Simple things like: have a build server, use source control, write tests.  Jared's talk was focused on fixing extremely broken teams, which appealed to me at the time.  His book was in my reading list for a long time, and just recently I had a chance to read it, so I wanted to share some thoughts.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Ship It! is extremely valuable for broken teams.  I would recommend everyone at least pick up a copy of the book and skim it.  If your company isn't already doing the things he lists, your team is probably broken.  As it happens, it took so long between seeing the talk and reading the book that I now work for a company that utilizes every single suggestion in the book, plus many more that help delivery quality code consistently.</p>
<p>That said, there are two parts of the book that I take serious issue with, which are the focal points of this post.</p>
<p><b>Tech Leads</b></p>
<p>Richardson suggests that a critical part of a team's infrastructure is a Tech Lead.  Someone on the team needs to have some managerial duties while still maintaining technical knowledge of the system.  Understand how it's architected, how it's coded, and so forth.  This ensures that someone on the team with high visibility to management understands how hard certain features may be to add, or why estimates for certain things are so high (or low).</p>
<p>I agree with this for the most part.  A Tech Lead is a valuable addition to a team.</p>
<p>Jared explains what the duties of the Tech Lead should be.  They are, to quote the book:</p>
<p>One of these stands out to me.  Richardson suggests that one of the Tech Lead's responsibilities is to prioritize The List, which is essentially the list of things that need to be done with a project (Agilistas call it the Backlog).  </p>
<p>This is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>Not only should that not be the Tech Lead's responsibility, the Tech Lead may actually be one of the worst people to give this job.  While I wholeheartedly recommend that any struggling team read the book and adopt the practices it describes, I take strong exception to this one.  </p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that you had a small startup.  The startup's business is writing software that helps automate the process of creating those little plastic tips that go on shoelaces.  The company is very small: you only have a single customer, and your company consists of 1 President, 2 Marketing Folks, 3 Salespeople, and 4 developers.  One of the developers has been designated the "Tech Lead".</p>
<p>You've got a list of features that can be added to the product on a whiteboard, but the developers aren't sure what to work on first.  Someone needs to come along and rank the list of features in order of importance.  In this scenario, who at the company is the best person to do this?</p>
<p>If you answered "Tech Lead", you must be Jared Richardson!  Welcome to my blog, Jared!  Sadly, you are wrong.</p>
<p>This was actually a trick question.  Nobody at the company should rank these features.  The one customer you have should do it.  Professional software development is about delivering value to customers, and nobody at the company is in a better position to know what customers want than actual customers.  </p>
<p>Of course, there may be reasons that this cannot be done.  The customer may be remote.  Or you may have more than one customer, in which case this becomes very difficult.  In this case, what you need is someone at the company that can <b>represent</b> the interests of the customer.  Who is it, now?</p>
<p>It's still not the tech lead.  You want people as close to the customers as possible to be making these decisions, since having the actual customers would be best.  In this case, nobody is in a better position to understand the needs of the customers than the salespeople.  They are the ones talking to the customers on a regular basis, they are the ones figuring out what features sell the product to people.  One of the salespeople should be the ranker.</p>
<p>If no salesperson can do it, the next closest link to the customers is either marketing or the president.  I could see an argument being made in either direction.</p>
<p>The Tech Lead will be more likely to undervalue difficult features.  Anyone who has worked in software for any significant length of time should be able to understand this.  Think about a time someone suggested to a team of developers that a certain feature be implemented and the developers responded negatively.  Were the negative responses focused on arguing that users may not actually like that feature, or that it would make the application more difficult to use?  Maybe sometimes.  But the majority of the time, when developers object it's because "the system isn't built to do something like that," or "that's going to take way too long to write," or "that's going to be really slow," or, my personal favorite, "that's impossible!"</p>
<p>Imagine if any one of these developers had the responsibility of prioritizing the work to be done on a product.  The "that's impossible!" effect would lead to extremely difficult items being ranked lower more often, even if they were extremely valuable to customers.  What's more, imagine this developer not only had the developer's mindset, but was the lead developer, the person whose ass is on the line if the team misses deadlines.  This would exacerbate the tendency to rank difficult items lower on the list.</p>
<p>Once the rankings for the items to be worked on have been affected by anything other than "customer value" your list is no longer supporting the business, but hurting it.  Even if a single developer were to be in charge of the ranking, it would be better than the Tech Lead, because the Tech Lead would have an even greater tendency to make the same ranking mistakes as the developer.  Essentially, the worst person to be ranking work is the Tech Lead.</p>
<p>I know, personally, when people at a company tell me about their ideas for a product, my brain starts trying to work out how I would implement it.  I can't help it.  I'm a developer, and the thing developers are best at is figuring out how to turn an idea into something a computer can do.  Even if I try as hard as I can not to think about implementation, I do it anyway (at least a little bit).  As long as the person evaluating features has a technical understanding of the system, they are going to let implementation affect their evaluation (at least a little bit).</p>
<p>The person who does the ranking should be thinking only about customer value, never about technical details: leave that to developers and their estimates.  In Agile, ranking the list is the job of the Product Owner.  If you can't get a product owner, find someone in sales or marketing that can fill this role.</p>
