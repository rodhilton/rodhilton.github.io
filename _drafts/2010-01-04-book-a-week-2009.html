<p>I really enjoy reading, but I often find that I don't have the time or energy to read as often as I'd like.  Starting at the beginning of 2009, I decided to make a few changes that would enable me to read more often, and I challenged myself with the goal of reading 52 books in the year, one per week.  The two changes I made were:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Taking the bus</strong> - Whenever I tried reading before bed, I'd fall asleep after a page or two.  I needed a way to allocate time for myself exclusively for reading, and I realized a great way to do that was to replace the wasted time of my daily commute with productive time reading.  I started taking the bus to and from work, which increased my commute time a bit but in return gave me a good chunk of reading time.</li>
<li><strong>Listening to audiobooks</strong> - Instead of listening to the radio or podcasts, I made it a point to listen to an audiobook any time I wanted to listen to something.  I listened to audiobooks when driving, when waiting for the bus, and (most importantly) while at the gym.</li>
</ol>
<p>My grand total fell a bit short of the 52, but I still learned a great deal from reading a number of excellent books.  I'd like to offer some quick reviews of the books I've read for the benefit of anyone that shares my reading interests.  I do a lot of reading about programming, technology, science, religion, and marketing.  Because of how often books fall under two or more of those categories, I didn't bother listing these books in groups, so they are in plain-old alphabetical order.</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Agile Development</strong></p>
<p>I reviewed this book in more detail <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2009/02/19/book-review-the-art-of-agile-development/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Bible: A Biography</strong></p>
<p>"The Bible: A Biography" by Karen Armstrong is a bit of an odd book.  The title is very intentional, the book analyzes the Bible not even so much as a book but as a character that has evolved over time.  The Bible is almost personified in the biography, which is an interesting approach.</p>
<p>I've had a number of books by Karen Armstrong on my shelves for a while (somewhere around 6 of them) but had never actually sat down to read any of them.  "The Bible" was the first Armstrong book I had read, and I'm honestly not sure I'm ever going to read any of her others now.</p>
<p>I found this book surprisingly dull overall.  The book suffers from simply uninteresting prose, and while it is very informative, it is very difficult to get through.  I found that most of the information in the book had been covered in other books I've read, mostly by Bart Ehrman.  Ehrman's books are, on the whole, more well-written than this one, and thus a more pleasurable read.  Though a great deal of information has been compressed into a single book (and it feels that way), I'd recommend reading three of four Ehrman books instead of this one.  It will take longer, but retention of information will be higher since they are more interesting.</p>
<p>Rating: 2/5.</p>
<p><strong>Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy and the New Science of Desire</strong></p>
<p>"Buyology" by Martin Lindstrom has a fascinating premise: use the technology of MRI and apply it to understand the effects of advertising.</p>
<p>One interesting thing I learned from the book was that the "negative ads" such as anti-smoking ads actually trigger the part of the brain in the smoker that makes them want to light up, having the opposite of the intended effect.</p>
<p>The science of the book is pretty good - plentiful citations make the book as convincing as it is interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the section comparing the effect of strong brand identity to the effect of religious belief, backing it up with solid scientific studies.  Good science helps support the idea that product placement is far more effective than regular advertising techniques.</p>
<p>As interesting as the book is, it is a bit overlong.  I often felt that Lindstrom was repeating himself for no particular reason.</p>

<p>I've written a more detailed review of this book here.</p>
<p><strong>The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark</strong></p>
<p>Put simply, no scientist writes for a nonscientific audience as well as Carl Sagan.  His book, Demon-Haunted World, is, perhaps, his most targeted work at the layman.</p>
<p>The Demon-Haunted World is, essentially, Sagan's plea with the average joe to understand and value science and the scientific method.  The book covers various superstitious beliefs and explains why they should be treated as nonsense.</p>
<p>Reading the book is a bit frustrating.  One thing that comes across in the book is something akin to desperation.  You can almost feel Sagan pleading with people to basically stop being such superstitious morons.  He explains why being superstitious and ignorant is bad, and what kind of real effects it can have on everyday life of everyday people when the scientific quest for truth isn't given priority.  I read Sagan's pleas and I agree with him, but the fact is that the book was written nearly fifteen years ago, and we still live in a world that tolerates and even glorifies belief in superstitious nonsense.</p>
<p>Sagan completely debunks theories about UFOs and alien abductions and, though those are not terribly popular topics these days, they have simply been replaced by new superstitions (such as alternative medicine).  Sagan devotes a great section of the book to discussing the insidious nature of hypnotherapy that uncovers repressed memories, which people don't really talk about today, so that feels like kind of a win.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting section is Sagan's analysis of ghosts, aliens, and angels.  He argues that these are all essentially manifestations of the same gullibility in human beings, and eloquently points out a shocking number of similarities between these superstitions that I had never noticed before.</p>
<p>Overall, an excellent book that not enough people have read, or would read.</p>
