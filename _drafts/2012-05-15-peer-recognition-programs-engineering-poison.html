<p>Nearly every company I've ever worked for has had some kind of peer recognition program.  Employee of the Month, MVP awards, and similar monickers all describe the same thing: recognizing individual contributors for outstanding performance at work.  These systems make sense from a high level, and I can see why they might work at Wal-mart and other similar workplaces.</p>
<p>After seeing so many different forms of these programs over the years, I have decided that they simply do not work for Engineering.  In fact, I believe they work against Engineering, doing exactly the opposite of what they should do.</p>
<p>- ask your dev team what they truly think of your program.  the response i hear the most is "its just a way for salespeople to give each other awards".  A boss once asked me what I thought of it, and I said "it's salespeople jerking each other off and I have to sit and watch".  these awards tend to go to salespeople above any other field.  why?  because its extremely easy to quantify when a salesman goes above and beyond.  His or her monthly sales are tracked regularly, and it's easy to see when a particular month or quarter is well above their average.  its harder to quantify performance in other fields - we can know marketing does very well because a particualr campaign might be tracked from an analytic standpoint, and we can see an increase in interest due to the marketing campaign, or HR might hire 50% more people in a quarter than usual.  But how do you quantify good engineering?</p>
<p>Well, the sad answer is that it's quite easy to do that as well.  Engineering has a tendency to pull late nights - working 60 hour weeks right before a big release, or working over a weekend to resolve a production issue.  A manager will tell the higher-ups "hey, my team worked until 8 all week and then through the weekend to get this code deployed, we should recognize them" and it's easy to see this deserves some kind of recognition.  Unfortunately, this rewards exactly the wrong behavior - if you're working 60 hour weeks, it's because you did a bad job of predicting how long things would take.  And if the work is significantly harder than you expected, its because your code is harder to work with than you anticipated (probably from cutting corners during the last 60-hour session).  If you're troubleshooting deployments over the weekend, its because you fucked up earlier in the chain.  The only way to get into a situation where you can be rewarded for excelling in your job is to perform poorly at the job months prior.</p>
