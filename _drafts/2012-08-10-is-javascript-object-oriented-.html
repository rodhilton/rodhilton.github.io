<p>I once thought that js wasn't truly object oriented, because it doesnt allow for class-based inheritance.  Ive had this debate so much with other developers, and I've gone back and forth on the answer myself over the years.  </p>
<p>ive been harsh, and ive decided something</p>
<p>there is no such thing as an object-oriented programming langage.  there is no such thing as a functional language, or a procedural language, or a logical language either.</p>
<p>Languages cannot truly have these properties.  What can have these properties is the programming itself.</p>
<p>Your CODE is what is Object-Oriented, not the language you write it in.  You can write completely procedural code in Java.  You can write totally Object-oriented code in scala.</p>
<p>What matters is, when you are designing your code, are you doing <x>-style programming?  If the language you are using, supports, out of the box, constructs to enable you to do that, then for all intents and purposes its an object-oriented language.</p>
<p>Functional programming is:</p>
<p>Java does not meet this definition, because functions can't be passed around.  You can use libraries, or do some silly hacks with classes that implment a single method, but the language doesnt make it easy to do.  Scala, Clojure, Haskell all do.  Those languages make it easy to do functional programming, so they are, for any useful definition, functional programming languages.</p>
<p>so how do I know if I'm doing object-oriented programming?</p>
<p>simple: I'm creating structures which contain both state as well as methods to manipulate that state.  </p>
<p>that's it.  inheritance, polymorphism, these are choices that make things easy for certain styles, but they're not relevant to the object oriented question</p>
<p>---i dunno, read hte wiki page. this might be stupid.---</x></p>
