<p>I've seen a lot of different teams switch from Subversion to Git.  This is usually a good thing, because Git is awesome.</p>
<p>But often, because teams are used to working with SVN a certain way, they are often lost with regard to how to use Git most effectively.  Git has lots of interesting features, so naturally teams want to use those features effectively, getting the most out of their Git.</p>
<p>There seems to be a point in every team's Git adoption cycle where one member of the team e-mails the rest of the team with <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this link</a>.  "Hey, look what I found!  We should do this!"</p>
<p>The link article, which is generally referred to as "git-flow" looks appealing - it seems organized, there are lots and lots of diagrams, and even a set of <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">git extensions</a>.  For a team that feels adrift at sea in the world of Git, git-flow is a piece of driftwood they can latch onto.</p>
<p>I've seen this happen so many times, that I can almost predict the week after the team starts using Git that a team member will discover the link and send it out.  And my response is always the same:</p>
<p><strong>git-flow is poison.</strong></p>

<p>notes: notice the vertical pink lines. these represent long-running branches.  look at how many pink circles you have on the two adjacent vertical lines before they are in the same repo.</p>
<p>these long running branches are a time bomb, waiting until a future merge.</p>
<p>you might think "ill merch the development branch into my own branch often, so integration wont be a problem". wrong. its not a problem for alice, but bob is doing the same thing. so their code is never intersecting.  merges become nightmares, so people delay them, making them even worse.  also note that all of this code is running without being checked by CI.</p>
