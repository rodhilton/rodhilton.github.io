<p>1. only half of you are working (only one person can type at a time).  this is dumb, typing is not the bottleneck, thinking is. two brains are better than one.<br />
2. it slows us down. if it slows you down, you have a problem.<br />
3. this code is too simple for pair programming - if your code is braindead and you dont have to think about it, it probably is bad.  this sounds like code that's just copy-pasted and slightly modified.  extract methods, refactor the code, improve the design. this requires thought, and doing it makes it much easier for the next person to understand and modify the code. you should be doing the hard thinking so the next person doesnt have to.  if your code is braindead to write, you arent trying hard enough to make it good.<br />
4. (not sure the reason), the objection to it is that when theres an emergency, the code you write is usually paired. if its good enough for that code, its good enough for all code.<br />
5. im not that social - get the fuck over it.  you're not entitled to a job where you get to ignore your team members. (this point sucks)<br />
6. i want to get in the zone - the zone is badf</p>
