				<p>Within the broad spectrum of human feeling, there lies an emotion very much unlike its biochemical brethren: the sense of regret. What separates regret from other emotions is not its potency, but its resilience. Joy, misery, love, and even grief can dull or dissipate given enough time, but regret endures, gnawing at the back of one’s mind, reminding each of us of what could have been, but is not. Regret never wanes and it never dissolves; <strong>regret festers</strong>. </p><p>Like so many others, I have accumulated a number of regrets over my life.  Though I’ve learned to live with many of these, one regret in particular has lingered in my mind for the past six years: I regret the limitations I placed on myself as an undergraduate at the University of Rochester.</p><p>Since I was a child, I’ve known that what I wanted to do with my life was write computer programs.  From the moment of my first experience writing code on the glowing box attached to a 286 in my father’s study, I’ve been driven by a vivid, clear goal of writing software professionally.  Since the age of 6, whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I gave the same answer.  When I told my high school guidance counselor, he told me that I needed to go to school and major in Computer Science, so that’s what I did.</p><p>What I found as early as my first year at school was that my selected major included a variety of subjects that I was not expecting.  I was exposed to material that seemed wholly unrelated to writing programs professionally.  Algorithmic complexity?  Turing machines?  Chomsky Normal Form?  It all seemed too theoretical, too far removed from the actual process of programming.  I needed to prepare myself for my career, and I felt I had no time for theory.  I decided to spend the next four years avoiding the theoretical material as much as possible.  Instead, I focused on my systems classes, which I found both engrossing and practical.  <strong>I even recall how proud I was for passing a particular theory class without more than a cursory glance at the textbook</strong>.</p>

				<p>At Rally, we&#39;ve stayed committed for the last 7 years to never telling the business that the product has to halt active development to pay down technical debt.  For us, the &quot;big rewrite in the sky&quot; has always been off the table.  Instead, we prefer to incrementally refactor and improve the existing elements of the codebase, gradually getting it to where we want it to be without ever halting feature development completely.</p><p>This has never been an easy task.  The truth is, the codebase is quite old by engineering standards, many parts of it written before standards emerged in the industry.  Our entire persistence layer, for example, was created by hand well before libraries such as Hibernate existed (or at least, before they became standard practice).  This means that there are many, many areas of the code that we&#39;d like to attack and improve.</p><p>One thing we&#39;ve started doing is holding lunchtime &quot;refactotums,&quot; where we take a look at some code and try to improve it.  Of course, with such a large codebase, and so many areas of the code that have not been touched since they were first written, we&#39;ve often wondered how to most effectively spend our refactotum time.  This led us to wonder &quot;what are the areas of the code where a refactoring would have the greatest impact?&quot;</p><p>We started keeping track of our codebase using <a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> which was extremely helpful in keeping track of metrics at a class level, but it didn&#39;t give us quite enough information.  For example, if <code>Class A</code> has a complexity score of 500 and <code>Class B</code> has a complexity score of 200 (higher is worse), you&#39;d think that spending some time cleaning up <code>Class A</code> would be the most effective thing to do.  But what if <code>Class B</code> is used by 50 times as many other classes as <code>Class A</code>?  Or what if <code>Class B</code>, complicated as it is, has never been modified in the history of the project?  It would be nice to clean this class up, but it might be a better use of time to focus on <code>Class A</code></p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been disturbed by a few posts made by James Shore lately.  Though I greatly respect Shore and immensely enjoyed <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2009/02/19/book-review-the-art-of-agile-development/">his book</a>, one particular post of his really irked me: &quot;<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Your-Certification-is-Meaningless.html">Your Certification Is Meaningless</a>.&quot;</p><p>In the post, Shore basically argues that certifications, particular those relating to Agile software development, have no value.  In fact, he goes on to <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Alternatives-to-Certifications.html">argue</a> that they offer counter-value, that some employers are LESS likely to hire someone with a certification.</p><p>The thing is, the main reason this bothers me is that I have a few certifications from Sun (pre-Oracle days), and the process I went through to acquire these certifications is one I found immensely useful.  <strong>It&#39;s hard for me to see something as meaningless when it holds so much value to me.</strong></p><p>This is not to say I don&#39;t understand the point.  The certification merely proves that I took a test, and considering how low a score you can get and still &quot;pass&quot; the test and receive the certification, it proves little more than that I read a book or took a course.  I agree with this basic assessment of certifications: as a token of proof to offer someone else that I know my stuff, they have very little value.</p>

				<p>One of the most common sources of tension between product owners and developers is when product owners are surprised at how high an estimate for a story might be.  Usually this tension is easy to resolve by reiterating that the product owners really have no concept of how much something should cost.  However, there is one scenario I see over and over again: when a product owner protests the estimate of a story because it seems, to the PO, like it&#39;s simply re-using an aspect of the system somewhere else.</p><p>&quot;I already paid for that!&quot; he or she might say, quite correctly.  A simple example recently for us here was our column picker.  Our grids allow you to select which columns you wish to see on any given grid.  Later on, we created the ability to have grids inside of panels on user dashboards.  Our product owner wanted to put the column picker on the settings pane of a grid panel.  To him, this was simply reusing the column picker that had already been created for an earlier story.  He was quite shocked when our estimate for the effort was just as high as it was the first time.</p><p>His frustration is completely understandable.  How is this possible?  Why isn&#39;t it easy to just drop that component into another place and have it work?  After all, if we were good engineers, wouldn&#39;t we have written that component to be reusable?</p><p>Actually, <strong>no</strong>.  It&#39;s <strong>because</strong> we were good engineers that it wasn&#39;t written in that way.  This is one of the hardest things for product owners to understand, and I hope to explain it in this post.</p>

				<p>The thesis for my Master&#39;s degree in Software Engineering is finished.</p><p>It&#39;s the result of many months of research, I hope others may find it interesting and informative.</p><p>Test-Driven Development is a Software Engineering practice gaining increasing popularity within the software industry. Many studies have been done to determine the effectiveness of Test-Driven Development, but most of them evaluate effectiveness according to a reduction in defects. This kind of evaluation ignores one of the primary claimed benefits of Test-Driven Development: that it improves the design of code. To evaluate this claim of Test-Driven Development advocates, it is important to evaluate the effect of Test-Driven Development upon object-oriented metrics that measure the quality of the code itself. Some studies have measured code in this manner, but they generally have not worked with real-world code written in a natural, industrial setting. Thus, this work utilizes Open Source Software as a sample for evaluation, separating Open Source projects that were written using Test-Driven Development from those that were not. These projects are then evaluated according to various object-oriented metrics to determine the overall effectiveness of Test-Driven Development as a practice for improving the quality of code. This study finds that Test-Driven Development provides a substantial improvement in code quality in the categories of cohesion, coupling, and code complexity.</p><p>If you&#39;d like to read it, you can download it here:</p>

				<p>Many developers think of unit tests as tests that test a single class.  In fact, I myself once thought this way.  If I wanted to write unit tests for a two-class system in which a class used another class, I&#39;d write two unit tests.  After all, if I created instances of both classes in my test, that wouldn&#39;t <strong>really</strong> be a unit test, would it?</p><p>In recent years, I have revised my stance on this matter.

				<p>I do not belong to the cult of iPod.  I use a nonstandard mp3 player and I hate iTunes.  If I&#39;m going to use an mp3 player, it needs to show up as a USB drive on my Linux workstation, my Windows desktop, and my Mac laptop.  I need to be able to drag files over and be done with it.  So far, I&#39;ve been successful at accomplishing this.</p><p>But the simplicity comes with a price.  I cannot download books from <a href="http://www.audible.com">Audible.com</a> and put them on my player to listen to them.  I have to convert all of the files I download from Audible into DRM-free mp3 files.  There are lots of ways to do this, and even software tools that will do this automatically, but <strong>all of them just play the file in iTunes and capture the audio stream to a file</strong>.  I want something completely digital, which can run in the background without me having to worry about my operating system making other sounds that interfere with the result.</p><p>I have developed an alternative to this method, which lets you convert your Audible audio book downloads to DRM-free mp3s in just a few minutes, with a very small amount of manual work.</p><p>On Audible.com, find the book you want and download it.  Make sure that it downloads using the Audible Download Manager and results in you getting .aa files for the book.  If Audible tries to make you download something else, you may have to add a new device on Audible.com.  Pick something simple (not an iPod) and select &#39;Format 4&#39; for the desired type.</p>
