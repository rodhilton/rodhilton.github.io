				<p>Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.rallydev.com">Rally Software</a>.  In two weeks, I will be starting a new job, working on a variety of web services, mostly with Java and Groovy.</p>

<table class='image alignright' width='306'><tr><td><img src='/assets/IMG_20110531_104216-300x224.jpg' width='300' height='224'/></td></tr></table>

<p>Leaving Rally was tough for me.  It&#39;s easy to leave a job when I&#39;m unhappy, or irritated with management, or tired of a project, or if I&#39;m just not learning anything new.  But none of these were the case with Rally.  I&#39;m leaving not because anything is wrong with Rally, but because there&#39;s simply a better opportunity for me elsewhere.  Time Warner is in downtown Denver (right near campus), they have a great benefits and tuition reimbursement program, they&#39;re working with technology I want to know more about, and their staff reads like a fantasy league of my career (I already know half the developers from other jobs).  The switch just made sense for me, but it wasn&#39;t easy to leave.</p>

<p>When I started at Rally nearly 3 years ago, it was a company that was struggling.  Not financially, but technologically.  For a long time, the company had done very well spreading agile to various customers, led by a product that was having features added to it at a breakneck pace.  <strong>From the outside, the company seemed to have things together, but internally the codebase was a monument of technical debt and hasty decisions.</strong></p>

<p>The company had survived in &quot;startup mode&quot; for years, but the team was starting to buckle under the pressure of technical debt.  Feature development was slowing, and external bug reports were flooding in. Things weren&#39;t looking good.</p>

				<p>Everyone who&#39;s been programming professionally for a while knows the standard format of the technical interview.  You go in, there&#39;s a whiteboard in the room, and you write code on it to answer questions.</p>

<p>Everyone also has the same basic complaints about these interviews.  In a normal work environment, you have access to an API or search engine, but at a whiteboard you don&#39;t.  Whiteboard questions generally don&#39;t include much in the way of overall design, and they&#39;re typically limited to simple algorithms, so they don&#39;t really test all of a candidate&#39;s skills.  And let&#39;s be honest, programmers tend to have awful handwriting, and writing vertically on a large board doesn&#39;t help things.</p>

<p><strong>We like coding.</strong>  We like sitting at a computer.  We like running ideas by our coworkers and our compilers.  The whiteboard interview helps interviewers know a bit about candidates, but it doesn&#39;t help candidates learn anything about interviewers.  In short, the standard interview leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>At my current company, we&#39;ve tried to improve the technical interview by augmenting it with something else: <strong>a pairing exercise</strong>.</p>

				<p>The Wordpress <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyphenator/">Hyphenator</a> plugin is a great plugin that uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/">Hyphenator.js</a> to perform client-side hyphenation of blog posts.  I think this makes full-justified posts look much nicer, and I use it extensively on this site.</p>

<p>Hyphenator.js relies on being told what classnames to look for in a page to know what can be hyphenated, but it also has an option called <code>donthyphenateclassname</code> which allows one to specify classnames that never get hyphenated, even when they are inside of a class that ought to be.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Hyphenator Wordpress plugin does not support this option.  I needed support for it, so I added it.  I don&#39;t really know of a place to submit this patch, so I&#39;m posting it here.  This patch has been applied to <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyphenator/download/">version 3.2.0 of Hyphenator</a>.</p>

				<p>Within the broad spectrum of human feeling, there lies an emotion very much unlike its biochemical brethren: the sense of regret. What separates regret from other emotions is not its potency, but its resilience. Joy, misery, love, and even grief can dull or dissipate given enough time, but regret endures, gnawing at the back of one’s mind, reminding each of us of what could have been, but is not. Regret never wanes and it never dissolves; <strong>regret festers</strong>. </p>

<p>Like so many others, I have accumulated a number of regrets over my life.  Though I’ve learned to live with many of these, one regret in particular has lingered in my mind for the past six years: I regret the limitations I placed on myself as an undergraduate at the University of Rochester.</p>

<p>Since I was a child, I’ve known that what I wanted to do with my life was write computer programs.  From the moment of my first experience writing code on the glowing box attached to a 286 in my father’s study, I’ve been driven by a vivid, clear goal of writing software professionally.  Since the age of 6, whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I gave the same answer.  When I told my high school guidance counselor, he told me that I needed to go to school and major in Computer Science, so that’s what I did.</p>

<table class='image alignright' width='246'><tr><td><img src='/assets/4924928641_a758120c60_m.jpg' width='240' height='180'/><p class='caption'>Clearly, I was a popular guy in college.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>What I found as early as my first year at school was that my selected major included a variety of subjects that I was not expecting.  I was exposed to material that seemed wholly unrelated to writing programs professionally.  Algorithmic complexity?  Turing machines?  Chomsky Normal Form?  It all seemed too theoretical, too far removed from the actual process of programming.  I needed to prepare myself for my career, and I felt I had no time for theory.  I decided to spend the next four years avoiding the theoretical material as much as possible.  Instead, I focused on my systems classes, which I found both engrossing and practical.  <strong>I even recall how proud I was for passing a particular theory class without more than a cursory glance at the textbook</strong>.</p>

				<p>There have been a number of blog posts and discussions lately around the evils of agile.  Lots of traffic recently surrounding an <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/2006/06/07/agile-people-still-dont-get-it/">old post by Cedric</a>.  This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3226711/giving-up-agile-switching-to-waterfall-is-this-right">stackoverflowist</a> is switching to waterfall.  Hell, agile ruined <a href="http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php">this guy’s life</a> - <strong>HIS ENTIRE LIFE</strong>!</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of agile software development, which should come as no surprise given that I work at Rally.  But honestly, I understand where all of this backlash is coming from.  Whenever someone has come to me and told me &quot;this is the way you will do things now,&quot; then decreed some elaborate, formal process I would have to follow, I’ve resented it.  Don’t tell me how to work.</p>

<p>But I think a lot of people who are annoyed at agile lately are confusing <strong>Agile</strong> with <strong>agile</strong>.</p>

<h1>&quot;agile&quot; with a lowercase a**</h1>

<p>In truth, &quot;agile&quot; – with a lowercase a – is not a process.  It’s not a ruleset, it’s a mindset.  A mindset that, to quote from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">manifesto</a>, values:</p>

				<p>At Rally, we&#39;ve stayed committed for the last 7 years to never telling the business that the product has to halt active development to pay down technical debt.  For us, the &quot;big rewrite in the sky&quot; has always been off the table.  Instead, we prefer to incrementally refactor and improve the existing elements of the codebase, gradually getting it to where we want it to be without ever halting feature development completely.</p>

<p>This has never been an easy task.  The truth is, the codebase is quite old by engineering standards, many parts of it written before standards emerged in the industry.  Our entire persistence layer, for example, was created by hand well before libraries such as Hibernate existed (or at least, before they became standard practice).  This means that there are many, many areas of the code that we&#39;d like to attack and improve.</p>

<p>One thing we&#39;ve started doing is holding lunchtime &quot;refactotums,&quot; where we take a look at some code and try to improve it.  Of course, with such a large codebase, and so many areas of the code that have not been touched since they were first written, we&#39;ve often wondered how to most effectively spend our refactotum time.  This led us to wonder &quot;what are the areas of the code where a refactoring would have the greatest impact?&quot;</p>

<p>We started keeping track of our codebase using <a href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> which was extremely helpful in keeping track of metrics at a class level, but it didn&#39;t give us quite enough information.  For example, if <code>Class A</code> has a complexity score of 500 and <code>Class B</code> has a complexity score of 200 (higher is worse), you&#39;d think that spending some time cleaning up <code>Class A</code> would be the most effective thing to do.  But what if <code>Class B</code> is used by 50 times as many other classes as <code>Class A</code>?  Or what if <code>Class B</code>, complicated as it is, has never been modified in the history of the project?  It would be nice to clean this class up, but it might be a better use of time to focus on <code>Class A</code></p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been disturbed by a few posts made by James Shore lately.  Though I greatly respect Shore and immensely enjoyed <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2009/02/19/book-review-the-art-of-agile-development/">his book</a>, one particular post of his really irked me: &quot;<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Your-Certification-is-Meaningless.html">Your Certification Is Meaningless</a>.&quot;</p>

<p>In the post, Shore basically argues that certifications, particular those relating to Agile software development, have no value.  In fact, he goes on to <a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Alternatives-to-Certifications.html">argue</a> that they offer counter-value, that some employers are LESS likely to hire someone with a certification.</p>

<p>The thing is, the main reason this bothers me is that I have a few certifications from Sun (pre-Oracle days), and the process I went through to acquire these certifications is one I found immensely useful.  <strong>It&#39;s hard for me to see something as meaningless when it holds so much value to me.</strong></p>

<p>This is not to say I don&#39;t understand the point.  The certification merely proves that I took a test, and considering how low a score you can get and still &quot;pass&quot; the test and receive the certification, it proves little more than that I read a book or took a course.  I agree with this basic assessment of certifications: as a token of proof to offer someone else that I know my stuff, they have very little value.</p>

				<p>There is one common type of question that I think sets up both the candidate and the interviewer for failure.  I&#39;ve seen it asked by my interviewers, my co-interviewers, and even by me. The question takes this format:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sketch out the object model for a (commonplace noun)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Generally this question is asked to feel out someone&#39;s OO skills.  Do they understand inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, etc?  Can they describe the relationship between a <em>plant</em>, <em>flower</em>, and <em>petal</em> (a flower is-a plant, and has-a petal)?</p>

<p>I used to ask this question myself when I was first starting out doing interviews.  I would ask the candidate to describe the object model for a <code>Chicken</code>.  I was expecting the candidate to sketch something resembling the following:</p>

				<p>One of the most common sources of tension between product owners and developers is when product owners are surprised at how high an estimate for a story might be.  Usually this tension is easy to resolve by reiterating that the product owners really have no concept of how much something should cost.  However, there is one scenario I see over and over again: when a product owner protests the estimate of a story because it seems, to the PO, like it&#39;s simply re-using an aspect of the system somewhere else.</p>

<p>&quot;I already paid for that!&quot; he or she might say, quite correctly.  A simple example recently for us here was our column picker.  Our grids allow you to select which columns you wish to see on any given grid.  Later on, we created the ability to have grids inside of panels on user dashboards.  Our product owner wanted to put the column picker on the settings pane of a grid panel.  To him, this was simply reusing the column picker that had already been created for an earlier story.  He was quite shocked when our estimate for the effort was just as high as it was the first time.</p>

<p>His frustration is completely understandable.  How is this possible?  Why isn&#39;t it easy to just drop that component into another place and have it work?  After all, if we were good engineers, wouldn&#39;t we have written that component to be reusable?</p>

<p>Actually, <strong>no</strong>.  It&#39;s <strong>because</strong> we were good engineers that it wasn&#39;t written in that way.  This is one of the hardest things for product owners to understand, and I hope to explain it in this post.</p>

				<p>The thesis for my Master&#39;s degree in Software Engineering is finished.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the result of many months of research, I hope others may find it interesting and informative.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>Test-Driven Development is a Software Engineering practice gaining increasing popularity within the software industry. Many studies have been done to determine the effectiveness of Test-Driven Development, but most of them evaluate effectiveness according to a reduction in defects. This kind of evaluation ignores one of the primary claimed benefits of Test-Driven Development: that it improves the design of code. To evaluate this claim of Test-Driven Development advocates, it is important to evaluate the effect of Test-Driven Development upon object-oriented metrics that measure the quality of the code itself. Some studies have measured code in this manner, but they generally have not worked with real-world code written in a natural, industrial setting. Thus, this work utilizes Open Source Software as a sample for evaluation, separating Open Source projects that were written using Test-Driven Development from those that were not. These projects are then evaluated according to various object-oriented metrics to determine the overall effectiveness of Test-Driven Development as a practice for improving the quality of code. This study finds that Test-Driven Development provides a substantial improvement in code quality in the categories of cohesion, coupling, and code complexity.</p>
