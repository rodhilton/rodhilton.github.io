<p>Since the end of my Spring 2013 semester, I&#39;ve been in &quot;Research Phase&quot;.  This means I&#39;m finished with classwork and have been working on my research project.  It&#39;s been a little over two years now, so here&#39;s what has happened.</p>

<h1 id=toc-picking-a-project>Picking a Project</h1>

<p>About two years ago, I started working with my advisor trying to figure out what area my research would be in.  I&#39;ve always had a fascination with Genetic Algorithms and Metaheuristics, so I knew I wanted to do something involving that subfield.  Two of my projects at school utilized Genetic Algorithms, and I had a lot of experience in the area.</p>

<p>I went back to school to primarily focus on CS Theory &amp; Algorithms, but I knew my biggest strength was Software Engineering.  In other words, I like theory, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a real theoretician, and I wanted to play to my strengths a bit.  This meant I wanted to be writing real, working code, rather than proofs.  If I wound up proving anything interesting, that&#39;d be great, but I didn&#39;t want that to be part of my critical path to completing my PhD.  Lots of CS PhD&#39;s go off with a white board and paper and output some amazing results, but I knew that wasn&#39;t going to be me.</p>

<p>My first idea was to build some kind of framework for comparing different metaheuristics.  I&#39;ve worked extensively with Genetic Algorithms but that&#39;s just one of an entire class of Metaheuristics.  I had no experience with things like Swarm algorithms, Ant Colony System optimization, Tabu search, Simulated Anealing, and so on.  I thought it would be interesting to pick some known optimization problems like Traveling Salesman using <a href="http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/">TSPLIB</a>, code various &#39;solvers&#39; using different techniques, and compare their performances.</p>

<p>I started building out the project, codenaming it <code>judy</code> (because it was like a judge, ha ha.  My advisor hated this name and told me to change it.)  Unfortunately, while doing a literature review in this area I discovered that it&#39;s more or less accepted that all metaheuristics have a similar level of effectiveness.</p>

<p>The more I researched, the more I realized that this would probably not be a valuable contribution to the the field.  It was becoming very clear that this project wasn&#39;t well-formulated, and wasn&#39;t going to be successful.  I hadn&#39;t spent very long on it, building out some parts of Judy but not much more.  I needed to pick a different project, but I was still very interested in Metaheuristics, so I knew I wanted it to be closely related.</p>

<h1 id=toc-course-correction-picking-a-similar-but-different-project>Course Correction: Picking a Similar But Different Project</h1>

<p>I had already built out some parts of Judy by this point and had some pretty promising software.  In fact the <a href="https://github.com/rodhilton/metaheuristics-engine">metaheuristics-engine</a> I had been building was a pretty nifty generic simulator for metaheuristic algorithms.  I&#39;d used my skills as a software engineer to build a few interfaces that were easy to implement and then dump directly into a simulator that would scale out for however many processors were on a machine, handle as much of the metaheuristic algorithm in parallel as possible, and do various neat things like safe-journaling results (so that an interrupted simulation could resume).  Thus, writing new metaheuristic implementations to search problem spaces would be really easy and fun.</p>

<p>I wanted to use this software because I enjoyed building it, and I thought it would be cool to enhance the capabilities of my metaheuristic engine as a side-artifact of my research.  I had also started building out a taxonomy of metaheuristics and how they were related in terms of object-oriented relationships (for example, a <code>GeneticAlgorithm</code> was a type of <code>EvolutionaryAlgorithm</code> in a formally-defined way, because one extended the other polymorphically).</p>

<p>I went to another professor, the one who taught the classes where my projects utilized Genetic Algorithms.  I knew she had a whole bag of interesting problems to solve, and I wondered if I could use my simulator to find solutions.</p>

<p>Basically all of her problems were existence questions.  Things like, does there exist a graph $$G$$ such that $$Y$$, with $$Y$$ being a variety of different restrictions.  She&#39;d posed a similar problem before, which was the motivator behind <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rodhilton/rectangle-visibility-and-elusive-k23">my project in her Graph Theory class</a>.</p>

<p>Most of these graphs would have their existence proven not by formal proof, but by construction.  Meaning, if I could construct a particular kind of graph, that graph itself would be the interesting result (and not necessarily how I derived it).  My idea was, for each of her problems, I would figure out a way to randomly generate potential solutions, a way to score solutions in terms of how close they are to the ideal, and a way to mutate or perform crossover mutation with candidate solutions.  I&#39;d write code for the problems, use/enhance my simulator, and then run the simulation on our ultrapowerful university computer across hundreds of threads.</p>

<p>When I took on this project, <strong>I knew that it was high-risk/high-reward</strong>.  For every problem I was working on, it was entirely possible that the solution I was looking for does not exist (remember, the only proofs possible are via construction).  I also knew it was possible that even if it exists, my strategy might not find it, or that my approach might get stuck in local optima.  In other words - I was essentially applying a technique intended for discovering SUBOPTIMAL results to optimization problems, hoping that that the threshold for optimality would be low enough that the technique could work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been two years since I started this project.  In that time, I have been working on three different particular problems, growing my metaheuristics solution engine, and heavily taxing the resources on the university parallel computation platform.</p>

<p>The first problem I worked on has been running for the longest time.  Since this was a continuation of my project in my advisor&#39;s Graph Theory class, I simply adapted it to used my new and improved simulator, and put it up on our university multiprocessor machine.  I&#39;m not going to bore you with the details but basically I&#39;ve been trying to find a particular graph configuration with certain restrictions, to see if a complete graph of a certain size exists.  Since I&#39;m looking for a complete graph, the &#39;fitness&#39; criteria is simply, how many edges my best solution has, out of a possible $$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$ edges.  About a year ago (after running for a year), my software managed to get ONE edge away from the desired answer.  As of this writing, it is still one edge away from the solution I&#39;m trying to discover, which seems to be the best it can do (205,949,225 generations).  Unfortunately this is not an interesting or publishable result unless I can uncover that one missing edge.  It&#39;s always possible that the software will find the correct solution tomorrow, but I think at this point I need to admit this is a dead-end.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked on two other problems but of those, I&#39;ve spent about 95% of my time on just one of them.  This particular problem (again, I&#39;ll spare the details) is one that&#39;s been plaguing my advisor herself for over twenty years.  I vividly recall one day in Algorithms class when she told the class that, if someone can discover particular graph with a specific set of properties, &quot;I&#39;ll give you a PhD right there.&quot;  It was this problem I chose to work on for most of these last two years.</p>

<p>Again, this too was a high-risk/high-reward project.  My advisor and I joked that the entire publication that results from this effort would be a couple pages about the background and the reason for wanting to know if this graph exists, and the entire results section would be a single page - a listing and rendering of the graph.  If I had found a result, there&#39;s no question that a paper about it would be accepted in virtually any CS journal I sent it to.</p>

<p>But once again, I&#39;ve been working on this project for a little over two years now.  I recognize that it seems early to ``give up&#39;&#39; given that it&#39;s been plaguing my professor for decades, but she&#39;s been trying to construct the graph by hand and my goal was to use the metaheuristics to perform a guided search of the solution space computationally.  In the end though, I&#39;ve become convinced after two years of working on this that either the solution doesn&#39;t exist, or that it does exist but my technique will not discover it.</p>

<h1 id=toc-walking-away>Walking Away</h1>

<p>This past semester my wife and I found out that we were going to be having a baby girl in April.  Very suddenly, I started to evaluate the relative importance of my degree.  It started to feel very stupid to be working on a series of high-risk/high-reward research projects where nothing had panned out in two years.  These problems were unbounded in every sense - my simulations might discover a solution after a day, a week, a year, ten years, a thousand years, or never.  I started to become increasingly uncomfortable with the notion of continuing down a path of research so open-ended, with the possibility that I was programmatically searching for solutions that may not even exist.</p>

<p>When I first decided to go back to school, I did it for fun.  I enjoyed my Master&#39;s research and wanted to continue learning and educating myself, and I liked the idea of pursuing a Doctorate.  At the time, I told myself and my wife that, since I was doing it for fun and not for any professional reason, that I&#39;d stop the instant it stopped being fun.  Well, after two years of research that wasn&#39;t panning out, school had certainly stopped being fun for me.  In fact, it&#39;s been a source of constant stress and irritation.  I&#39;ve been working very hard and building some really cool software, but I have no interesting results to show for it.</p>

<p>The analogy I used to describe how I was feeling to my wife was, it was as if I saw people mountain climbing and I thought it looked really fun, and I wanted to do it as well.  So I spent a great deal of time and money taking mountainclimbing classes.  Then I began researching mountainclimbing gear and spending a great deal of money on equipment.  I planned and scheduled flights to various mountain ranges.  Then I finally started climbing mountains and realized &quot;you know what?  This sucks.  I&#39;m really cold, and this isn&#39;t fun at all.&quot;  But because I&#39;d spent so much time and money on it, I felt like I had to keep going even though I hated it it, falling victim to the sunk cost fallacy.</p>

<p>After a great deal of thought I decided I would walk away from the PhD altogether.  This was not an easy decision, given how much work I&#39;d put into things like the GREs, classes (straight A&#39;s), and passing my preliminary exams.  But after two years and nothing publishable to show for all my research work, with a baby on the way, I felt like I needed to re-prioritize and know when to fold &#39;em, so to speak.</p>

<h1 id=toc-or-not>...Or Not?</h1>

<p>I scheduled a meeting with my advisor to discuss my departure from the program.  I was all set to walk away, and in fact had written the entire above portion of this blog post.  I had basically accepted that I was done, I killed the processes on the university supercomputer, and moved a ton of books and articles out of my to-read list on Goodreads.  Washing my hands of the project and admitting I was no longer pursuing it was extremely liberating - I felt like a huge burden had been lifted simply by shutting down the effort.  </p>

<p>But then I realized something.  My main motivator for coming back to school was how much I enjoyed my Master&#39;s Thesis research, and that I wanted to do more.  I had thought that I must love research, and wanted to continue it.  The past two years made me realize I didn&#39;t actually enjoy research as much as I thought - a fact that I had trouble coalescing with how much I enjoyed my Master&#39;s research.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, the author of <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Beyond-Legacy-Code-Practices-Software/dp/1680500791?sa-no-redirect=1">Beyond Legacy Code</a> contacted me to say he referenced my Master&#39;s thesis in his book.  He praised my effort, talking about how much he enjoyed it and how he felt it was one of the better entries he&#39;s come across.  It made me look back at my thesis and remember how much I enjoyed working on it.</p>

<p>Then it dawned on me.  Was it possible that it wasn&#39;t the research I enjoyed at the time, but the actual subject?  If it was the subject, then would a research project more inline with my Master&#39;s appeal to me more?  I had come back to school for Theory &amp; Algorithms, and I was so laser-focused on those subjects that it hadn&#39;t occured to me that I might enjoy classes in these topics but <em>not</em> research.  Would I enjoy a research project if it were focused on Software Engineering, like my Master&#39;s?</p>

<p>Pondering this for a few more days, I suddenly had a new idea for a research project.  This was something much more Software Engineering-focused than what I had been working on - in fact it wasn&#39;t related to CS Theory at all.  It was more of a natural continuation of my Master&#39;s work, and I was stunned by how <strong>excited</strong> I was by the idea.  I once again felt the passion of wanting to complete my PhD, reinvigorated by this new project.  My wife commented that she hadn&#39;t seen me this excited about research in the entire two years I&#39;d been working on my metaheuristics project.</p>

<p>Of course, there have been some logistical issues.  Since I went back to school primarily to focus on Theory, nearly every class I&#39;ve taken has been theory-heavy.  Due to this, every single professor I&#39;ve met or worked with has been a theory professor, not a single one of them is experienced, or even interested in Software Engineering research.  </p>

<p>The meeting with my advisor, which I had originally scheduled to tell her I was dropping out of the program, went very differently.  I had come up with the new project and done some publication searching all between scheduling the advising meeting and actually having it.  So when I walked into her office, I presented her with my new project idea.</p>

<p>I expected her to hate the idea since it&#39;s so unrelated to theory.  Instead, her reaction was basically, if I&#39;m passionate about the project she&#39;ll help in any way she can.  She doesn&#39;t have a lot of experience with Software Engineering but I don&#39;t think I need a lot of help with the topic - this is what I know best.  </p>

<p>So that&#39;s my status update.  Baby on the way, feeling a strong desire/pressure to finish this PhD quickly, and basically starting over entirely in the research.  Reading it back, it seems downright idiotic, but I feel extremely excited about my new project, and for some reason I don&#39;t feel worried.</p>

<p>I still feel the same way about the program - this is something I&#39;m doing for fun, and the instant I&#39;m miserable in the program I will walk away.  But if there&#39;s any path that ends with me actually completing this degree, I feel like I&#39;m finally on it.</p>

<p>The next update about school will either be announcing that I&#39;ve completed my dissertation and am graduating, or that I&#39;ve decided to walk away from the program for good.</p>

<h2 id=toc-tl-dr>TL;DR</h2>

<p>Too rambly but you still sort of care?  Here it is in a nutshell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided the research project I&#39;ve been working on for two years was a dead-end.  I almost decided to walk away from the program entirely, but instead have started over with a radically different project to give it one last shot before calling it quits.</p>
