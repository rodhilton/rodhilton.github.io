<p>I purchased the Android phone from Google not too long ago.  I plan on posting a detailed review of it someday soon, but I wanted to post this now in case anyone needed it.</p>
<p>Just recently Google started pushing new firmware to the phone with a bunch of new features.  My phone suddenly popped up a screen asking if I wanted to install the update, but I was in the middle of something so I said "Update Later."  The screen vanished, and when I finished what I was doing I was unable to find a way to make the phone check for updates and try again.</p>
<p>Here is how to do it if you do the same thing I did.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, have AnyCut installed if you don't already</li>
<li>Next, Create a new shortcut on your phone's desktop.  Select "AnyCut" and then select "Activity"</li>
<li>Select "Device Info" as your activity.  I can't find any other way to get to this activity on the phone</li>
<li>Press the new shortcut icon you have created.</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom and find the "Check for Updates" button.  Click it.  You may have to a few times for it to succeed.</li>
<li>Once the "checkin" has succeeded, exit back to your home screen and you will be prompted to install the update.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it!</p>
