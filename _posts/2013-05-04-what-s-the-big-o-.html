<p>people always ask "what is the big-oh" but this question is useless.  big o is upper bound.  if you ask me the big -oh of anything, I can tell you O(infinity) and I'm correct.  What you're really asking for is the big-theta.</p>
<p>big omega is lower bound.  everything is omega(1)</p>
<p>Big O and Big Omega are for when I tell you about an algorithm.  I give you an algorithm, and I tell you, "dont worry, worse case its bounded by a polynomial, O(n^3)".  r I might say, here's an algorithm, but it's Omega(n) meaning it cannot possibly take less time than linear.</p>
<p>Big Oh and Big Omega are things whose only purpose is for me to TELL you about them, when volunteering the algorithm itself.</p>
<p>If I were to ASK you, I'd be wanting the big theta.  This means tight bound, upper and lower.  </p>
