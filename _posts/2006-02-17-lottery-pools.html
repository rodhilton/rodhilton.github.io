<p>A bunch of my co-workers are getting together for a Powerball Lottery Pool.  As a hater of all things fun, my immediate reaction to this is to explain how such a thing is a worthless gesture.  I know, however, that if I say this to them, they will win the lottery and I'll look like a jackass, even though I was still mathematically right.</p>
<p>Thus I will blog about it instead.  Since nobody reads my blog, I can avoid the problem of the Universe conspiring to embarass me by doing this.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>So here it is.  A lottery pool helps your ODDS, but it does not increase your EXPECTED VALUE (EV), which is the bottom line.</p>
<p>Let's say you play a dice game where you pay one dollar to play.  Everyone puts in their money and bets on what number will come up.  Your number comes up and you win the money bet so far (split among the folks who also bet on the same number, obviously).</p>
<p>So your ODDS of winning are one in six.  If you play six times, on average you will win once.  </p>
<p>So let's look at a series of 6 games.  The first 5 games, you bet and lose your dollar.  On the last game, however, you win (1 in 6 chance), and you get, let's say, 20 dollars.</p>
<p>Your Expected Value is the average amount of money you win when you play the game.  You have a 1/6th chance of winning 20 bucks, but a 5/6th chance of losing one dollar. </p>
<p>Thus your net cash is: (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + (-1) + 19 = $14.  The reason for the 19 is that on that round you spent one dollar and gained 20.  Your Expected Value, then, is $14/6, which is the average winning per game.  That's $2.33.  Obviously this game is worth playing.  The more you play, the more you win.</p>
<p>Another way to arrive at this number is with this formula: (Chance Of Winning) * (Dollar Amount For Win) + (Chance Of Losing) * (Dollar Amount For Loss).  In this case, the chance of winning is 1/6, the cash you get is $19.  The chance of losing is 5/6, and the cash is -$1.  (1/6)*(19)+(5/6)*(-1) = 19/6 + -5/6 = 3.16666 + -0.833333 = 2.33.  So our math is right.</p>
<p>When deciding if you should play a game, you want to analyze the expected value, not the odds.  The odds of winning the game are poor (1 in 6) but the expected value is high.  In fact, the expected value is not negative, so it's a good game to play.</p>
<p>Let's say, now, you go in with a friend.  You bet on six, he bets on five.  You both put in one dollar each, and you agree to split the winnings.</p>
<p>Now when the dice are rolled, you have a 2/6 chance of winning, or a 1/3rd chance.  That means you ought to win after only 3 games, on average.  But remember, you're paying 2 dollars per round now</p>
<p>So now the equation is (-2) + (-2) + 18 = 14.  Thus the expected value is 14/3 = $4.66.  So it seems better than the $2.33 EV (which is why it's tempting), but then that money has to be split between you and your friend, leaving you each with $2.33.  Thus, the end result expected value FOR YOU is the same even if you go in with a partner.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about this is that you increase your chances of winning by a factor of X, where X is the total number of people going in on the bet together.  Then the winnings, whatever they are, are split by X as well.  X*(EV)/X = EV.  The Xs cancel, leaving you with the same expected value, no matter how many people you go in on the bet with.</p>
<p>All of that being said, as soon as the rest of the team pitched in their five bucks, I had a vision of everyone except me winning the lottery and splitting the money, retiring and leaving me with a really depressing story to tell people.  I pitched in.</p>
<p>And I know it's mathematically stupid.  Dammit.</p>
