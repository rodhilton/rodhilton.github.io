<p>I used to work for <a href="http://www.rallydev.com">Rally Software</a>, a company that developed a product which helped companies manage their agile development process.  Though the product always had lots of room for improvement, I felt (and still feel) like it's a really good tool for agile teams.</p>
<p>When I left that company and took another job, I was somewhat dismayed to discover they were managing their Scrum process with <a href="http://www.assembla.com">Assembla</a>.  Obviously I would have preferred the tool that I helped develop, but after looking at the interface and seeing how similar it looked, I tried to give it an honest chance.</p>
<p>I found that it's relatively usable, but I also found a number of irritations with it.  Not just "it does it differently than I'd like" kind of stuff but often "this encourages bad, non-agile behaviors" kind of stuff, particularly surrounding how blockages are handled on the Cardwall.</p>
<p>Today I was in a planning meeting, using their Cardwall feature.  I noticed, at the top of each column, was a total of all of the estimations of the stories in it.  What I was shocked to see was that the icon chosen to represent that number was this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/Screen-shot-2011-09-08-at-11.22.14-AM.png" alt="" title="Screen shot 2011-09-08 at 11.22.14 AM" width="62" height="30" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1438" /></p>
<p>A clock?  To represent cumulative story points?  This re-enforces one of the most common mistakes Scrum teams make, treating points as units of time.  Story Points are <a href="http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-effort-estimation-and-story-points/">unitless, not a measure of time</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>When I discovered this, I tweeted about it and included the picture above:</p>
<p>[tweet from="rodhilton"]This is how @assembla displays the total of story POINTS in Cardwall view. It's a CLOCK. You suck, @assembla.[/tweet]</p>
<p>And then further elucidated my thoughts, letting out some of the frustration I've felt using Assembla for the past few months:</p>
<p>[tweet from="rodhilton"]This helps validate my theory that @assembla is an agile tool made by people do don't understand agile.[/tweet]</p>
<p>To my surprise, Assembla responded to my tweets with three of their own:</p>
<p>[tweet from="assembla"]@rodhilton Yes, it is It's true that we are skeptical in our support for estimating and some scrum processes, but not our support for agile.[/tweet]</p>
<p>[tweet from="assembla"]@rodhilton We recently added an option to estimate with points. The planner icon has not been updated. What icon do you prefer?[/tweet]</p>
<p>[tweet from="assembla"]@rodhilton We love agile, release frequently, but aren't yet big supporters of all of the estimating that goes with Scrum sprint planning[/tweet]</p>
<p>Really?  If they aren't big supporters of Scrum, what the hell are they doing selling a Scrum tool?</p>
<p>I responded:</p>
<p>[tweet from="rodhilton"]Suspicions confirmed. RT @assembla Yes, it is It's true that we are skeptical in our support for estimating and some scrum processes[/tweet]</p>
<p>[tweet from="rodhilton"]@assembla Any icon that doesn't imply that POINTS are a unit of TIME. Jesus, just write "Points:" if you can't think of a decent icon.[/tweet]</p>
<p>A short time later, I was thinking about just how dysfunctional this attitude is, and it made me really miss using Rally.</p>
<p>So I made one last tweet on the subject:</p>
<p>[tweet from="rodhilton"]God I miss using @RallySoftware. @assembla can eat a bag of dicks.[/tweet]</p>
<p>I expected Assembla would not be responding to me any more after that one.</p>
<p>What I did not expect was what they actually did:  they contacted the management at my current employer.</p>
<p>Someone at assembla emailed a manager, saying that my tweets were unprofessional and went as far as to call them slander.  He even asked that I be forced to remove my posts.</p>
<p>How completely ridiculous.</p>
<p>First of all, my personal twitter account does not fall under the purview of my employer.  I do not tweet as a representative of my employer, merely as an individual.  I tweeted about a product I am using that I happen to dislike.  I'm entitled to my personal opinions, and, yes, I'm entitled to say extremely unprofessional things if I'm so inclined (frankly that's pretty much all I do on Twitter).</p>
<p>Secondly, it's incredibly disturbing that Assembla felt it was even appropriate to contact my employer's management at all.  What did they think would happen, that I'd get fired?  For what?  Not liking Assembla?  Being an asshole on Twitter?  Assembla, I have 200 followers.  Nobody gives a shit about me, thicken your damn skin.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1451" align="alignright" width="300" caption="&quot;Slander is spoken.  In print, it&#039;s libel.&quot;"]<img src="assets/Jksimmonsjonahmovie-300x205.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" height="205" class="size-medium wp-image-1451" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Thirdly, he referred to it as <b>slander</b>.  That's a pretty serious term to throw around so casually; he was saying that I was breaking the law.  Slander means making false statements to injure a reputation.  What false statements did I make?  I claimed that Assembla uses a clock icon for points, which is true.  I claimed that doing so "validates my theory" that Assembla doesn't understand agile, which is merely a statement of my opinion.  Then I claimed that they can eat a bag of dicks.  Well shit, I'm sure they <em>can</em>.</p>
<p>The real question here is: how did Assembla find out where I worked?  I've never tweeted about it, so in order to find out who to contact to attempt to silence me, they would have either had to navigate from my Twitter page to my blog and then to my LinkedIn profile, or they would have had to search for my username in their production database (it's worth mentioning that this email also contained the URL to my profile in Assembla).</p>
<p>When I worked at Rally, if I wanted access to customer data (maybe due to a bug that couldn't be reproduced without it), I had to make a formal request of the Support team, who had to contact representatives at the customer's company, get written consent that developers could access their data, then formally request the Operations team (the only ones who had access to production) copy a subset of that customer's data into a local developer database for me to use.  All of these steps were logged for auditing purposes.  <b>We took customer data privacy extremely seriously</b>.</p>
<p>Is it possible that Assembla employees can just willy-nilly read private data of their customers for reasons as minor as having their feelings hurt on Twitter?  I suppose I'll never know for sure, but it certainly makes me want to read their privacy agreement pretty closely.</p>
<p>If your users are unhappy, even if they are so unhappy that they say inappropriate things about your product in public, you can either figure out why they are unhappy and try to fix it, or you can ignore them.  What you can't do is ask their boss to demand you be quieted <b>or else</b>.</p>
<p>For the curious, I still have my job, and I haven't removed any tweets, nor do I intend to.</p>
<p>Assembla, you can seriously eat a bag of dicks.</p>
