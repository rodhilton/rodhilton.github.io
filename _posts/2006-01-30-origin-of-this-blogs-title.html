<p>In case anyone was wondering where the title of this blog comes from (just kidding, nobody cares), I offer this explanation: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/grrl/supermodel92686/Extras.html">Absolutely No Machete Juggling</a></p>
<p>Read the third image down.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>That's an angelfire page, so it will probably be a 404 by the time I click "Publish" but basically it's a comic of two people standing on a sidewalk near a sign demanding "Absolutely No Machete Juggling."  One of the people, somewhat confused as to his motivation, turns to the other and says "Suddenly I have an urge to juggle machetes."  The cartoon is labeled "The Essence Of Human Nature."</p>
<p>I saw this cartoon when I was pretty young, and nothing ever stuck with me quite as much.  I actually say "No machete juggling, eh?" to people when they do something stupid because they were told not to.  Then they ask me what the hell I'm talking about and I have to explain the cartoon, which destroys any humor value it may have had.</p>
<p>In any case, I wanted a stupid name for a blog and I picked this because even ten years after I saw it, the line cracks me up.</p>
