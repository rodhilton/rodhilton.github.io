<p>According to various internet political quizzes, I fall somewhere between a Libertarian and a Democrat, usually much closer to the Libertarian side of things.  This is, I think, pretty accurate for me: I believe strongly in personal freedoms, and slightly less strongly in economic freedoms. Thus, when I turn to the blogosphere for news and opinions about politics, I hit a number of moderate Libertarian blogs, some extreme Libertarian blogs, and a Liberal blog or two. I don't read any conservative blogs because I'm pretty sure the goal of the modern Republican party is to convince Jesus to run for office after the Second Coming.  Personally, I find Jesus too soft on poverty.</p>
<p>There's a reason, however, I don't link to any of these blogs I read.  I mean, a reason that isn't "I'm too lazy to configure my wordpress links," which is the real reason.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The reason is because I'm absolutely sick to death of watching the "Blogosphere" validate itself. Look, I know that the Blogosphere is News 2.0 and all that other garbage, and that it will eventually replace CNN and so forth, but the problem with that idea is that, if it were a person, it's head would go up its own ass, through the entire body, out the mouth, then up the ass again.</p>
<p>The "Revolution" blogs will bring is not to replace CNN and Fox News.  Blogs are convenient, free, and entertaining, so people like them.  It's the FORMAT of blogs that are appealing, not the blogs themselves.  The format will be taken by major news outlets, that's all.  In fact, it already has to a significant degree; most blog content is merely a link to a legitimate news source followed by an opinion.  If blogs replace anything, they will replace OpEd columns.</p>
<p>I say all of this because I'm so sick of the political blogs I like validating the blogosphere by treating posts of bloggers as real news.  I used to read <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/">Eschaton</a> a lot.  I didn't often agree with Atrios, but I found the commentary often insightful and, at the very least, thought-provoking.  Eventually, though, it seemed like the blog became little more than a series of incredulous links to other bloggers, like Michelle Malkin, Andrew Sullivan, and the like.  Entire posts would be a link to another blogger's post followed by "Look how much an idiot this person is," in so many words.  I particularly enjoyed when the site started linking to a blog post as the "Wanker Of The Day" with no additional text at all.  Lots of blogs do this sort of thing now.</p>
<p>I don't care if Michelle Malkin is an idiot.  She's a blogger. She's not a politician.  She has no power. She's not running for office.  I don't care.  At all.  She's just some moron ranting and raving in the corner of the room.  So are you.  So am I.  For every blogger that discovers the Rathergate memos were fake, there are a thousand bloggers who feel obligated to unleash their written diarrhea into their blogging software in some uninformed kneejerk reaction to the first two paragraphs of a long article in a legitimate newspaper.</p>
<p>Have a blog?  Do your posts consistently get mentioned in the mainstream media (Slashdot does not count)?  If no, then you're just another idiot like everyone else and the fact that you installed Wordpress successfully does not mean your opinion is more valid or informed than any other random jerk on the street.</p>
<p>Since when was "Some blogger posted something stupid!" news?  Almost every post by every blogger is stupid, including this one!  I don't need to read commentary about some post by some idiot on Little Green Footballs.  I know that a lot of the "bloggers" are pretty new to this game, but way back when we internet dorks used a thing called Usenet, we had a name for people who posted idiotic garbage: Trolls.  Responding to them or validating their existence in any way was called "Feeding The Trolls" and it was frowned upon.</p>
<p>Linking to these posts and saying they are stupid serves little purpose other than to make the poster feel validated and, more importantly, the linker feel validated.  After all, you're linking to news, but you you linked to some blog, therefore that blog is news; you have a blog, therefore your blog is also news, rather than just some twit's opinion on stuff.</p>
<p>Well it's not.  It's a blog.  It's a relabeled LiveJournal with a heightened sense of self.  Current Mood: Pompous.</p>
<p>I don't care about your blog itself, or your blogging, or what it's like to be a blogger.  I really, really don't care about what you have to say about another blogger.</p>
<p>If your blog exists to analyze and provide interesting commentary on the political news items of the day, stop pretending some idiot's blog post counts as a "political news item."  It's not.  It's just some idiot.</p>
<p>Note: I realize the irony of linking to another blog and criticizing how all they do is criticize other blogs.  The difference is: I know my blog sucks.</p>
