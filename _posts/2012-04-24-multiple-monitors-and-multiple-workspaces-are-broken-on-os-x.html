<p>4 years ago, I got my first Mac.  I was starting at a company whose dev-team was all-Mac, and I bought one and forced myself to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>There were a number of things that annoyed me at first, such as the inability to create global application hotkeys in just the way I like, but eventually I got over most of the issues.</p>
<p>Two issues in particular annoyed me a great deal, and I never got over them.  Four years ago, I chalked this up to me being a Mac newbie, and I blamed myself.  But after four years, I've gotten much more comfortable with the operating system, and I can say with confidence:</p>
<p><b>The way that OS X handles multiple monitors and multiple workspaces ("spaces") is completely and fundamentally broken, to the point of complete unusability.</b></p>
<p>Most of the issues are related not to particular user interface choices</p>
<h1>Multiple Monitors</h1>
<p>What OS X does with multiple monitors is make you choose which monitor is your "primary" monitor.  The way you define this monitor is "it's whichever one has the menu bar on it".  There is only one menu bar.</p>
<p>Your secondary monitor will have no menu bar on it.  That means that if you put an application window on the secondary monitor, it's menu is on the other monitor.  Interacting with the menu requires moving your mouse to the monitor the application is not on, and clicking there.</p>
<p>The whole IDEA of the menu bar concept from Apple, in juxtaposition to the Windows style of one-menu-per-window, is that you have an easy place to throw your mouse with an infinite pixel area to interact with the menu.  Having to first move the mouse to the opposite monitor completely breaks this idea.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, to see a correct implementation of this, look at Unity on Ubuntu.  I know, I know, Unity isn't exactly a community favorite right now, but it gets this right.</p>
<p>Open two windows, one on each monitor, then maximize them both.  Now you are operating in a manner similar to OS X, where the top bar acts as both a menu bar as well as an OS bar, with tray icons and such to the right.  Notice that both windows have their OWN menu, which exists on whatever monitor the application is on.</p>
<p>That's how OS X ought to work.  Second monitor means a second menu bar, and the "primary" monitor is defined as whichever one has my tray icons on its bar.  This way, no matter what application I am interacting with, the menu for it is always "straight up".  </p>
<p>You can "fix" this with <software> but it's really not that functional, and it still doesn't work correctly - it just duplicates the bar so that there's always <b>a</b> menu straight up, but it still leaves the relationship between the window on screen and the menu above it disjointed.</p>
<h1>Multiple Workspaces</h1>
<p>I've completely disabled Spaces on all of my Macs.  Laptop, work, home, one space for all.  I can tell longtime Mac users think I'm crazy for working like this, but I've watched Spaces-fanatics at work, and I've concluded anecdotally that they are actually slowing themselves down.</p>
<p>In Apple's perfect world, everything you do on your computer will have an Application, purchased through the App Store.  That's how they make a cut on every dollar you give to other programmers.  But that's not how things work in reality.</p>
<p>Let's take an example of a natural split someone might want to make.  Two spaces, one for whatever project you're working on, the other for communication.  So the one on the right has your mail client, your IM client, your Tweetie application, and Skype.  Your left one has, say, IntelliJ.</p>
<p>Now, you want to take a quick break and check your Facebook.  You switch to Space 2 and open up Firefox and check.  Nobody has liked your last status update, your friends are jerks.  Anyway, back to work, switch back to Space 1.  Hmm, your project is giving you an error, so you decide to Google it.  Click Firefox and, WHOOPS, you're back in Space 2.  Okay, okay</p>
<p>example of a space with a fuckton of command prompts, all unrelated, and a space with all of the firefoxes.  people trying to do a single related task that requires all of those windows switching back and forth between multiple spaces.  only solution is to put firefox and terminal in ALL spaces, but now your facebook shit is in the wrong space.</p>
<p>Mac users are forced to think about their Spaces separation in terms of Applications, not tasks.  But that's not how people think - every application they need in order to complete their current task falls under the umbrella of that task.  The more that "applications" move to the web, the fewer overall applications people will have, and the more cross-functional their browser will be.  Apple wants you to install the Pandora app, but if you listen to Pandora in the browser, what do you do with your "Space 3" for music, which used to be occupied by iTunes?</p>
