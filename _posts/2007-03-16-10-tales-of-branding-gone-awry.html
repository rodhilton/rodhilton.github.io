<p>One of the things I find most interesting about an open-market is the effect of diminishing returns on the concept of branding.  When a company comes out with a product, that's their brand, and they want their brand to saturate as deeply as possible into the market - to a point.</p>
<p>There comes a point during market saturation where the brand is <b>too</b> ubiquitous, too universal, and it starts to actually hurt the company by threatening their trademarks.  If everyone refers to a <b>type</b> of product using a specific brand of that product, the company that makes that brand can potentially lose their trademark, as the word becomes a synonym with the product type.  </p>
<p>As an example, let's talk about the Zeppelin.  Zeppelin, if you look in the dictionary, is a word that refers to a specific type of aircraft.  <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Zeppelin&x=0&y=0">Dictionary.com</a> defines it as "a large dirigible balloon consisting of a long, cylindrical, covered framework containing compartments or cells filled with gas, and of various structures for holding the engines, passengers, etc."  Zeppelin, however, wasn't originally intended as a generic name for rigid airships - it was a specific type of ship being manufactured by Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the late 19th century.  Von Zeppelin started out building passenger aircraft for use by DELAG, one of the first commercial airlines. The Zeppelin was too successful, however.  The Zeppelin became pretty much the ONLY aircraft used by Germany after World War I started, and thus Ferdinand von Zeppelin, making it ubiquitous.  Because of this ubiquity, the term eventually lost any kind of brand-association and became a word that simply means any kind of rigid airship.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating, mainly because the forces of overbranding are so much stronger in an age of easy communication.  The culture can shift drastically extremely quickly, and companies are in danger of losing their brand-names before they are even aware that it is happening.  There are many stories about a brand saturating to the point where it loses its brand-association, and I'd like to share them here.  Here are my favorite 10.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Linoleum</b> - The word is today used to refer to a type of flooring commonly used in kitchens but originally it was a specific product.  The formula for linoleum flooring was even patented by its inventor, Frederick Walton.  He started a company named "Linoleum Manufacturing Company" and developed his new type of flooring.  He had so much success that, as you can imagine, the term started being used to refer to flooring that wasn't manufactured by the Linoleum company.  Today, the flooring we generally use in our kitchens is actually polyvinyl chloride, but we still use the word "linoleum".</li>
<li><b>Bikini</b> - Louis Réard filed for a trademark for the term Bikini in 1946, given its name from the Bikini Atoll islands, where nuclear tests were performed weeks prior.  The two-piece swimsuits achieved a moderate level of success in Paris where they were invented and introduced. However, Bikinis were banned from the Miss World Competition, which would have been a primary mechanism for showing the Bikini to people all over the world.  It wasn't until the 60's that the Bikini really began to take off in the United States, fueled in part by the sexual revolution and in part by a pop song called "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini".  A Bikini-buying spree began, making Bikinis extremely popular very quickly.  Many people assume that the "bi" in "bikini" is the traditional "two" prefix, and you can today buy "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monokini">monokinis</a>" and "trikinis" in some places.</li>
<li><b>Margarine</b> - Emperor Louis Napoleon III offered a prize to anyone who could develop a butter substitute in the 1860's.  Hippolyte Mège-Mouriés responded by inventing "oleomargarine", a substance that used liquid extracted from beef fat to create a buttery flavor. Mège-Mouriés shortened "oleomargarine" to "Margarine" and sold his invention. Unfortunately, the product spread across the globe quicker than marketers could, and the butter-substitute lost any kind of brand-association.  Today, the process by which margarine is manufactured has changed drastically, but the name persists.</li>
<li><b>Granola</b> - In the 1800's, Granola was a trademarked name in the United States for certain types of whole-grain products.  The food fell out of favor over time, and was largely forgotten until the 1960's, when people began mixing it with fruit and nuts.  This revived granola as a food, but it came without the trademarked name.  Interestingly, the "Granola" trademark still exists in Australia, where it is owned by Australian Health & Nutrition Association Ltd.'s Sanitarium Health Food Company.</li>
<li><b>Zipper</b> - The B. F. Goodrich Company marketed a new fastener for clothing based on a design by Gideon Sundback.  This concept wasn't actually new, and variations had been in circulation for some time.  After the Zipper became a major hit for trousers, it wasn't long before the word Zipper was being used to refer to other types of teeth-based fasteners.  As a result, the word lost any sense of brand.</li>

<li><b>Kleenex<b> - "Can you hand me a kleenex?".</b></b></li>
<p>    * Yo-yo</p>
<p>Just about everyone knows that Kleenex, Band-aid, and Xerox were once brand names.<br />
aspirin<br />
band aid theme song<br />
thermos</p>
<p>mention google, moto, and the danger of ipod</ol>
