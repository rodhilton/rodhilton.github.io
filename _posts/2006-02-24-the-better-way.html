<p>While writing a paper for a software engineering class, I wanted to make mention of how often software developers have to write code while knowing there must be "A Better Way" that they can't think of.</p>
<p>I like to offer worthless statistics with every baseless assertion I make, so I checked a source-code search engine, <a href="http://www.koders.com">koders.com</a> and searched for the phrase "better way".  Any self-respecting developer who goes through the familiar process of giving up on finding the better way and just writes it using a shitty hack would put a comment in the code, at least making it clear he or she recognizes that the code is awful.</p>
<p>Indeed, when you perform <a href="http://www.koders.com/Default.aspx?s=%22better+way%22">the search</a>, there are over 2,000 hits, most of which seem to be comments asking "is there a better way?" followed by code that almost certainly is not.</p>
<p>It's a fun experiment.  Search your source code repository at work for "better way" and see how many of your developer kindred know the same feeling as you, begrudgingly implementing awful code because of a self-percieved failure to think of The Better Way.</p>
