<p>This is the first post I'm making to my new weblog.  I plan to use this weblog to explain things I discover as a professional software developer.  I am primarily a Java developer, but I am interested in many other languages and dabble in PHP, Python, Ruby, ColdFusion, C, and a host of other languages.  I'll also probably bitch about shitty movies and alienate you with wacky views on politics.  Enjoy, sucker.</p>
