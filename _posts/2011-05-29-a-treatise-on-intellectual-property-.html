<p><strong>Scene</strong></p>
<p>Two friends, Tom and Rick, are sitting down in a coffee shop together to have a drink and chat.  As they sit they notice Larry, a lawyer, sitting at the next table over.</p>
<p>Tom: So Rick, how did your date go last night?<br />
Rick: Great, we had sex.<br />
Larry: Sorry guys, but I couldn't help but overhear you guys.  You really shouldn't have sex before marriage.<br />
Rick: Oh God.  Listen buddy, I just don't see anything morally wrong about sex before marriage.<br />
Larry: Well, let me explain.   First, what would you say the difference is between <strong>premarital sex</strong> and <strong>rape</strong>?<br />
Rick: What?  They're nothing alike!<br />
Larry: Sure they are.  You weren't having sex, now you are.  Very similar.<br />
Tom: Premarital sex is consensual.  That's what makes it different.<br />
Larry: Alright, so would you agree that premarital sex is essentially consensual rape?<br />
Rick: What?!<br />
Tom: That's ridiculous.  Wouldn't marital sex also be consensual rape, then?<br />
Larry: Not at all.  Sex within marriage is in a completely different context - it's granted a special authority by a religious institution, and it is part of a general agreement between parties.  Wedding bands are exchanged, it's all very official.<br />
Rick: Okay fine, but "consensual rape" is a complete oxymoron.  It can't be rape if it's consensual.<br />
Larry: Sure, but since the only real difference between rape and premarital sex is whether it is consensual, it seems reasonable to call premarital sex consensual rape, doesn't it?<br />
Rick: Okay, sure, whatever.  For the record, I think that's stupid, but get to your point.<br />
Larry: Well, is it wrong to rape people?<br />
Rick: Are you serious?  Of course it's wrong to rape people!  In addition to being very obviously morally wrong, it has a number of painful effects on vicitms!<br />
Larry: And yet, if you have premarital sex, you are a consensual rapist.<br />
Rick: Are you out of your mind?  I'm not a rapist!<br />
Larry: Sure you are.  We agreed that premarital sex is consensual rape, so that means you are a rapist.  You should be tried as a rapist and go to jail.<br />
Rick: I'm floored with how idiotic you are.  Premarital sex is not illegal.<br />
Larry: Sure it is.  Rape is illegal, and premarital sex is consensual rape!<br />
Tom: This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  Premarital sex and rape are fundamentally different.<br />
Larry: They are basically the same.  They only differ by how consensual the act is.<br />
Tom: That's the difference that matters!  That's the part that makes one thing a heinous act, and the other thing victimless!<br />
Larry: Victimless?  What about the feelings of all the people who are affected?  What about sexually transmitted diseases?  What about out-of-wedlock pregnancies?  If 100% of sex were martial, these negatives wouldn't be issues!<br />
Tom: Okay fine, so it's not COMPLETELY victimless.  Premarital sex is, perhaps, somewhat less moral than marital sex, but not by a great deal, and nowhere near as bad as rape.<br />
Rick: In an ideal world, everyone would have marital sex, but it's not the end of the world if someone has sex before marriage. And it's absolutely not illegal.<br />
Larry: Or so you'd think.  While we were talking, I had my lawyer friends convince the police officer outside that premarital sex could be called "consensual rape" as well.  Here he comes now.<br />
Police Officer: Sir, you are under arrest for rape.<br />
Rick: You've got to be kidding me.<br />
Police Officer: Rape is not something to kid about.<br />
Rick: Premarital sex is not the same thing as rape!<br />
Police Officer: Tell it to the judge.<br />
Larry: I convinced the judge to use that phrase too, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion,</p>
<p><img src="assets/piracy.jpg" alt="piracy" title="piracy" width="345" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-664" /></p>
<p>Just because you call the thing being copied "intellectual property", that doesn't mean taking it is the same as taking ACTUAL property.</p>
<p>Piracy has negative consequences, but nothing approaching the consequences of actual theft.  Actual theft is obviously wrong, but people have had to be convinced that piracy is just as wrong, and the tool for making this argument has been the oxymoronic phrase "intellectual property"</p>
