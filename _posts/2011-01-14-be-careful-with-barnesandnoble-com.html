<p><em><strong>TL;DR for the attention-span deficient: BarnesAndNoble.com does not charge the amount on your receipt, and it does not tell you when it charges you more.</strong></em></p>
<p>For Christmas, I got two $25 gift cards for Barnes and Noble.  Since I'm a hermit, I decided I would spend these gift cards online, at <a href="http://www.bn.com">bn.com</a>.</p>
<p>With two $25 gift cards, I went about finding some stuff on my wish list that, combined, cost less than $50, even with shipping and tax.</p>
<p>After a while, I managed to fill my cart with three books: one from Barnes and Noble and two used books from authorized sellers on the site.  My total, including all shipping, was <b>$49.91</b>.  I entered my two gift card numbers at checkout and placed my order.  The <b>receipt</b> for my final order was exactly $49.91.  I got to check out without even entering a credit card number.</p>
<p>I was pretty proud of myself for leaving only 9 cents on the gift cards.  Normally gift cards trick you into spending your own money at a store, and I avoided that trap.</p>
<p>The next day, I got an e-mail from the Barnes and Noble system saying that my order had been declined.  I followed the link to my order details and noticed two things.  One, under one of my gift cards it said "<b>DECLINED</b>".  And two, my order was no longer for $49.91, but for <b>$52.18</b>.  Weird.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I called customer support to figure out why my gift card had been declined, and this is the conversation that took place with the Barnes and Noble representative, who I will refer to as Kathy, because that's her name.</p>
<p>[chat]<br />
Me: Hi, one of my gift cards got declined and I'm not sure why.  Also, the subtotal isn't the amount on my receipt.<br />
Kathy: Okay, what's your order number?<br />
Me: XXXXXXXXXX.<br />
Kathy: Oh, I see.  Your gift cards are fine, your order was declined because you only paid $50 of the $52.18 charge, so you need to pay the additional $2.27.<br />
Me: Okay... so, why is the charge higher than what's on my receipt?<br />
Kathy: Sales tax.  It's assessed after the order is completed.<br />
Me: That doesn't make any sense.  First of all, you should know the sales tax when I make the purchase, since I have to supply my billing address.  More importantly, though, I'm holding the receipt in my hand, the one from BarnesAndNoble.com, and it says "ORDER TOTAL: $49.91"<br />
Kathy: That's just a guesstimate.  It says on the site that the final number my change.<br />
Me: It doesn't say that anywhere on my receipt.  I mean, isn't a receipt binding?  You can't give me a receipt where we agree that I'll pay a certain amount, then charge me more, can you?<br />
Kathy: That's the policy.<br />
Me: Wait, so if I hadn't used gift cards, and had supplied my credit card instead, I'd have just been charged 2 bucks above what my receipt says, and I'd never know unless I checked with my bank?<br />
Kathy: That's correct.<br />
Me: How would you feel if you went to McDonalds and bought $10 worth of cheeseburgers, walked out with a receipt for $10, but then got charged $12?<br />
Kathy: I'm not going to argue with you sir.  Do you want to pay the extra $2.27 or not?<br />
Me: I guess I will.  How do I go in and add a credit card to my order so you can charge it?<br />
Kathy: You can't, but I can add it here.  Just say your credit card number and I can enter it.<br />
Me: Over the phone?  No thanks.  Just cancel my order.<br />
[/chat]</p>
<p>At this point, I'm pretty irritated on principle.  However, it is only $2, and if I don't buy books from Barnes and Noble, I won't be able to use the $50 worth of gift cards.  It takes a day for the order cancellation to go through and for the gift cards to be refunded, so I decided to try again later.</p>
<p>Today, I went through and I added the same books.  This time, I would add my gift cards as well as my credit card number, so that when the ridiculous extra $2 fee was added, there'd be a place to charge it (I hate giving out my credit card number on the phone).</p>
<p>Here's what's interesting.  Since my order total was still $49.91, it <b>didn't let me add my credit card number</b>, as my balance due was $0.  If I wanted to add a credit card, I had to add enough stuff to take the total above $50.  My only other option would be to remove one of the books, leaving my total far enough under $50 that, when the extra fee was added, there would be enough on the gift card to cover it.   But since I can't know for certain how much extra BarnesAndNoble.com will add to my order, it's quite difficult to optimize my spending. <b>This means that it is logistically impossible to spend nearly all of the money on my gift cards without spending some of my own money on BarnesAndNoble.com</b>.  In the end, I wound up replacing 2 of the books with one book that was slightly more expensive than the two of them together, just to get the total above $50 ($53.56).</p>
<p>I felt like a sucker for this, buying something more expensive just to get Barnes and Noble to take my credit card number and charge me more.  In actuality, I paid the $3.56 balance using Paypal, so I'm curious to see how this will play out.</p>
<p>Moral: be wary of BN.com, especially if you are using gift cards.  <strong>The amount on your receipt is not the amount they charge</strong>.  I'd also avoid giving anyone a Barnes and Noble gift card as a present, since there doesn't appear to be any reasonable way to spend the money without spending more (or wasting some of it).</p>
<p><b>UPDATE</b>: Apparently even though I approved a transaction for $3.56 using Paypal, later on that transaction vanished from my PayPal history and was replaced by a charge of $6.19.  The final charge wound up $56.19 on BN.com, even though my receipt is for $53.56.  So even with Paypal, Barnes and Noble still charges more than the receipt amount.  Got my books, though.</p>
