<p>I'm a big fan of the Firefox keyword-based search.  One thing I've always wanted is to be able to look up tv listings or shows easily.  I wrote something to do that, so I'll provide it here.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>For those that don't know, you can bookmark a link in firefox and use the parameter %s in the url.  Then when you follow that bookmark, you'll be prompted to input a value for %s.  For example, if you bookmarked</p>
<p>http://www.google.com/search?&q=%s</p>
<p>When you open that bookmark, you'll be prompted for a string, and when you click OK you'll be brought to a google search page for whatever you type.</p>
<p>You can also give this bookmark a 'keyword' in the Manage Bookmarks interface.  If I gave this bookmark the nickname 'g', then I can now type into my browser:</p>
<p>g mutton chops</p>
<p>and mutton chops will be filled in for %s, allowing me to get a google search right from the address bar.  I have a ton of these searches (I don't even use the Firefox QuickSearch bar), but one I've always wanted is for television shows.</p>
<p>I had yahoo listings come up when I typed 'tv' merely by giving the listings page a bookmark with a keyword 'tv'.  What I really wanted, though, was to be able to type 'tv' and get my local listings, but 'tv some show' and have it look up that show on tv.com and give me information on it, such as next air date.</p>
<p>I realized I could do this through a bookmarklet, so I've decided to share the results.  Note: you will need to log onto tv.com to make the listings page work, but after that it's just a cookie, so you should be fine. Bookmark this and make a keyword for the bookmark called 'tv':</p>
