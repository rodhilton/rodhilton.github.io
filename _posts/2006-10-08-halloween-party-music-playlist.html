<p>Last year, Julia and I had a halloween party for a group of friends.  Of course, we needed music for the thing, and I was put in charge of that.  I have a lot of music, so I figured it would be fun to put together a good halloween music playlist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whenever you look around for halloween music, you typically find CDs full of creepy sounds, thunderstorms, cackling, etc. While these CDs are definitely "halloween" they certainly aren't much fun to listen to.  Generally they are obnoxious.</p>
<p>So last year, I set about trying to find good songs by regular artists that could go on the playlist.  Every song had to be by someone who people would listen to regularly, and every song needed to relate to halloween in some way.</p>
<p>Considering the kind of music I listen to, this wasn't too terrible of a challenge, but it definitely was time consuming.  I figured that I'd go ahead and publish the playlist in order to save anyone with similar goals from spending time on this.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Below is the complete playlist.  It's total running length is a little over 8 hours, which is long enough for pretty much any party.  If you have any suggestions for things to add, please feel free to leave comments, but remember that it has to be regular music that relates to halloween in some way, not actual halloween music.</p>
