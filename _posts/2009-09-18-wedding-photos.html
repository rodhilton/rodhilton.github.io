<p>The photos from my wedding are up on Flickr.  Check 'em out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rodhilton/collections/72157621960411651/">here</a>.  Our <a href="http://www.annettedragonphotography.com/content.php">photographer</a> was excellent.  I highly recommend her.</p>

<p>The wedding was great.  Virtually nothing went wrong - we even just barely avoided some rain but avoided it nonetheless.  I was kind of dreading having to be social for a whole evening, but even the reception turned out to be a good time (though I had to go hide in order to eat my slice of cake).</p>
<p>Overall, being married doesn't feel too much different from not being married.  I've known I'd marry Julia since second week we dated, and I knew she'd make a beautiful bride (she did).</p>
<p>It was great seeing family and merging my 7-person family with her 100-something-person family.  I also really loved how many of our friends from college were able to make it, including one of my professors.  It was great seeing everyone again.</p>
<p>My friend Dennis was a fantastic Best Man, and Julia's sister Olivia did an wonderful job as Maid of Honor.  It was a truly unforgettable time.<br />
