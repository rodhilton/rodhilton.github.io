<p>I'm in the process of doing research about the usage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Test-Driven Development</a> within Open Source projects.  It's part of my master's thesis for <a href="http://www.regis.edu">Regis University</a>.</p>
<p>The survey only has <strong>three required questions</strong> and should take less than 30 seconds to fill out.  If you have worked on an open source project, please help me with my research by filling it out.</p>
<p>It would also help greatly if you distributed the link to this post or to the <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cHU2aHo5bS14cE04c2gzWGlhaUpQSHc6MA..">survey form itself</a> to your project mailing lists and encouraged other developers to fill it out as well.</p>
<p>When my research is complete, I'll post the results on this web site.  <strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
<p>The link to the survey is <strong><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cHU2aHo5bS14cE04c2gzWGlhaUpQSHc6MA..">here</a></strong>.</p>
