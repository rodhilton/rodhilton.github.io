<p>	I've worn glasses for nearsightedness since I was about 7.  I've tried contact lenses twice but because of my h2 prescription, the only contacts available to me were hard lenses that were not gas-permeable, which meant that it felt like I had a rock on my eye at all times.  I found contact lenses were just too difficult for me to insert and remove, my eyes are just too sensitive.  The last time a doctor put one in my eye, I had a panic attack and needed it removed in under 10 seconds.</p>
<p>	I've asked every optometrist I've ever seen if I could have eye surgery, and they've always told me no due to the strength of my prescription.  But just to find out once and for all, I went to an actual eye surgeon and asked him a month ago.  As it turns out, though my prescription would normally prohibit me from getting LASIK or PRK, my cornea thickness was well above average, which made it safe.</p>
<p>	For the benefit of anyone else who is considering LASIK, I've started writing down my day-by-day experiences with the surgery.  Some of these entries will be made on the day they describe, some will be made a day or two later.  I apologize ahead of time for the fact that my tenses will shift between present and past-tense at random.</p>
<h1>Pre-Surgery</h1>
<p>	I went to two different surgeons to make sure I was a good candidate for eye surgery.  Based on my own research, it sounded like PRK was the way to go, since it doesn't involve cutting a "flap" into the cornea at all, whereas LASIK does.  This was confirmed for me by the second of doctors the I saw, who expressed concern that my eyes were so deeply set that he thought they'd have trouble cutting a flap.  The first eye surgeon, however, said LASIK should be fine.</p>
<p>	I eventually decided to do the surgery with the first doctor I saw (the one who said LASIK would be fine), largely because the other doctor's office seemed a little run-down, and his hands shook a bit when he spoke, which made me nervous, as all I could do was imagine those shaky hands sticking sharp things into my eyeballs.  The other doctor was younger and seemed more confident.</p>
<p>	We had many discussions leading up to the surgery, since I was so nervous about the whole prospect.  During these discussions, my wife and I asked him about the issue of my deep-set eyes, and if that would be a problem for LASIK.  The doctor told me it should be fine, but that if he could not get a good flap cut that he would simply abort the procedure, let the flap heal back up, and do PRK instead.  This made the decision of LASIK vs PRK much easier for me, as my main concern about LASIK was that there would be a problem cutting the flap.  If the doctor was going to simply abort the procedure in that case, then it seemed safe.  So I decided to go with LASIK.</p>
<p>	Initially, I wanted to do one eye at a time as well.  I was concerned that, should something go terribly wrong, the worst-case scenario if I did one eye at a time was that I'd simply not do the second eye and continue wearing glasses.  Eventually the doctor convinced me that the procedure is so low-risk that this wasn't worth worrying about, and if he were in my position he would do both eyes at once so that I "don't have to sit in the chair twice".  This made sense, so I decided to go ahead and do both eyes at once.</p>
<h1>Day 0</h1>
<p>	The day before LASIK, I was getting pretty nervous.  I've never had surgery before, and the first thing that comes to mind when I think "surgery" is how my father had surgery for his sleep apnea, which led to a screwup of his vocal cords that permanently altered his voice to a low, scratchy, pained sound.  Part of me just kept thinking "What am I doing?  Why am I having unnecessary surgery for my eyes?  I need my eyes!  What if something goes wrong?"</p>
<p>	Ultimately I had to remind myself that I trusted my doctor, he knew what he was doing, and the chances of something going so wrong that I go blind is extremely low.  I was excited at the idea of never wearing glasses, but definitely nervous.</p>
<p>	I was taking 4 different kinds of eye drops today (and for a few days prior as well).  I have always had a hard time with eye drops (I hate things going in my eyes), but by this point I've gotten pretty good at it.</p>
<h1>Day 1: Surgery Day</h1>
<p> <!-- June 10, 2010 --></p>
<p>	I headed into the office 20 minutes before my appointment so I could get the rundown.  The office coordinator gave me a 5mg tablet of Valium for nerves and said she'd give me more if I was still nervous after a few minutes.</p>
<p>	I got an explanation of what the procedure would be like and was given two more kinds of eye drops to start taking.  A few minutes later, she noticed my leg was still pretty jittery and I got another 5mg of valium.</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/preop.jpg"><img src="assets/preop-225x300.jpg" alt="" title="Yellow Gunk" width="225" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-756" /></a></p>
<p>	I headed back to the surgery area.  Little blue slipper things were put over my shoes and a blue cap was put on my head.  They coated my eyes with some kind of yellow gunk and I waited a few more minutes.  They then gave me numbing drops to numb my eyeballs.  People I've talked to said they felt their eyeballs go numb, but I didn't feel anything.</p>
<p>	I was brought into the operating room and made to lay down.  More eye drops and then my chair was moved over underneath a machine with a blinking light.  After this was the part that sucked.</p>
<p>	A big metal apparatus was attached to my eye socket to hold my right eye open.  Though my eyeball was numb, the area around my eye was not, and I definitely felt this.  It was uncomfortable and somewhat terrifying, indicating that I should have perhaps taken additional valium.  Thankfully this was brief, but then an additional metal thing was attached.  This pulled on my eye which eventually made my vision to black.  Also terrifying and uncomfortable.  I later found out that this step was to pull my eyeball up with some suction so that the laser could cut the flap in my cornea.  This lasted a few seconds.  Then the doctor folded my flap over, making my vision go extra blurry.  I saw little instruments interacting with my eye but felt nothing.  This didn't bother me too much.</p>
<p>	Then I was told to stare at the blinking light and the laser made some clicking noises.  Saw little specks of blue in my field of vision and after about 30 seconds it was over.  The doctor closed my flap back and started on my left eye.</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/inthechair.jpg"><img src="assets/inthechair-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="In The Chair" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-758" /></a></p>
<p>	My left eye was tougher for some reason.  Getting the metal apparatus attached proved difficult, and he had to try two or three times to actually get it on there.  After that, I had a similar experience to the other eye - flap, blinking light, blue clicks, close flap.  This time I found myself struggling to look at the blinking light for some reason.  I was able to easily look at the spot right below it.  It turns out that the laser itself corrects for small movements of the eye (I had little markers put on my eye to help it track) and shuts off for big movements, so I'm told that this struggle did not have any negative effect.</p>
<p>	The experience was quite intense and pretty frightening, but tolerable.  They gave me little stress balls to squeeze (I'm told they were shaped like eyeballs, but I never saw them). </p>
<p>	Here is a video of the procedure on my left eye (with the attachment of the metal part skipped because it took so long).</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;"><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dPQzFepKRR8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/dPQzFepKRR8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></div>
<p>	The doctor said that my right eye got scratched a bit, so he put a bandage contact lens on it.</p>
<p>	My wife drove me home after the surgery and I was told to keep my eyes closed as much as possible.  I was given a set of goggles to prevent me from rubbing my eyes, which I wore the rest of the day and the night. The eyes were sore, but I don't know that I could say they "hurt".  Looking around hurt, so I left the eyes closed most of the time.</p>
<p>	I hopped into bed and started listening to an audiobook, but fell asleep within seconds.  After waking up, I rewound the audiobook to hear what I missed and started listening again, but fell asleep again.  Next time I woke the sun was setting and the bedroom had a lot of light because of the angle.  Even with my eyes closed, the light was bothering me, so I went into the guest room (which has light blocking curtains), listened to music, and went to sleep again.  I basically slept for 12 hours after the surgery.</p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>	Woke up and looked at my eyes.  It was pretty crazy to actually see myself somewhat clearly in a mirror without glasses.  I look very different.  I kept wanting to put glasses on, and I found myself pushing up on the bridge of glasses I wasn't wearing.  All very weird.</p>
<p>	My left eye had a big red splotch on it, a bit worrisome.  </p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/redeye.jpg"><img src="assets/redeye-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="Looks worse than it feels." width="224" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-753" /></a></p>
<p>	My right eye was pretty blurry, but I'm attributing that to the contact lens at this point.  The left eye is pretty clear, though not perfectly clear.  I'm also having trouble reading anything up close (books, computer screen, etc).  I was supposed to be able to go to work today, but reading anything gives me a headache, so I called in sick.</p>
<p>	Went to the doctor for my post-op appointment in the afternoon.  He removed the contact lens and I was disappointed to find that I still didn't see well out of my right eye.  He showed my wife through the microscope where the scratches were, and explained that they'd be healing over the next few days.</p>
<p>	As for the red splotch on the left eye, he explained that it was from the suction.  Popped a blood vessel, should go back to normal.  Overall, nothing bad, healing coming along well, all good.  I should expect my vision to improve over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>	Left eye vision much better today.  Went shopping for sunglasses (first time I could ever buy sunglasses).  Closed my right, still-blurry eye and looked at all sorts of stuff, was amazed at how clearly I could see far away things and even read text quite a way off in the distance.  Really loving the left eye at this point, but I get a headache because of the right eye blurriness, so I got an eyepatch to help take the strain off.</p>
<p>	The blood splotch is now closer to my iris, but the doctor said that's fine.  The right eye is clearer than the day before, but still quite blurry.</p>
<p>	I went to a movie that night and noticed a couple things.  One, because of the halo effects I'm having from light, watching a movie was pretty difficult (lots of halos all around everything).   Two, my eyes were prone to feeling tired, so I had a hard time keeping them open for the entire movie.  I actually nodded off a bit (I never do that in movies).</p>
<p>	I'm still taking a ton of different kinds of eye drops, actually having trouble keeping track of them all.  I'm an eyedrop pro now.</p>
<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p>	Today was a bit of a surprise.  My left eye, which was awesome yesterday, is a fair bit blurrier.  The right eye is about the same as yesterday, which doesn't bother me, but I'm upset that my left eye has gotten worse.</p>
<p>	I was in rough shape today.  Everything was blurry, I was still having trouble reading, and I don't own any glasses that can correct my vision.  Everything's blurry and I'm stuck with it.  Appointment with eye doctor scheduled for the next day, hoping to get some good news at this point.</p>
<p>	I'm officially awesome at putting in eye drops.  I spent most of the day watching TV and stuff.  The sensitivity to light has gone down significantly and I'm more able to read (though not for extended periods of time).</p>
<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p>	Today was a low point.  My left eye has not improved since yesterday and my right eye is the same.  At this point, it feels like my eyes are "done" changing and stuff is still too blurry to be tolerable.  I was very disappointed in the LASIK as of today.</p>
<p>	Saw the doctor in the morning.  He basically explained that my right eye has actually healed quite a bit but I still have one small scratch in the very center of my cornea, so even though it's healed so much I still won't be able to see well out of my right eye.  My wife looked through the thing and verified that my right eye had improved but I still had a scratch in exactly the worst possible place.</p>
<p>	He explained the reason for my left eye degrading.  Basically, because my right eye has been blurry, my left eye has been working double-time.  This has led to it drying out, and there were little dry spots on my eye that were preventing me from seeing well.  I had little sponge things inserted into my tear ducts so that my tears don't drain as normally, keeping my eye moist.  I was also given prescription eye drops to take hourly to help.  He says I'm healing well but recognizes why I'd feel frustrated.  He thinks I'm on my way to great vision, but it may be a couple days still.</p>
<p>	To help with my dry eyes, I've upped the lubricating drops to hourly, and I have a special "gel" kind of drop to put in at night.  These drops are weird - they blur my vision and basically seal my eyes shut.  Very strange.</p>
<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p>	When I woke up this morning, I thought my right eye was almost healed and thought my left eye was a bit better as well.  I put in my morning eye drops, then looked at various comparison anchor points I've been using to evaluate my eye status, only to discover things were exactly the same as yesterday.  Did the eye drops blur my vision?  That was weird.</p>
<p>	Getting tired of all these eye drops.  I'm attending a conference and it's tough to get drops in my hours every hour.  One of the drops, Pred Forte (4x daily) gets into my tear ducts, which makes it go down my throat.  Tastes like watered-down cement or something.</p>
<p>	I was at a conference all day today, from 7:30 AM to 10 PM, a full day of looking at presentations projected on a screen.  By 8 pm, the eyes were very tired and wanted a break.  Tough to make it to the end of the day.  I drove home, the first time driving at night since the surgery.  The halos on traffic and street lights made the drive very difficult - it was a good thing I lived close to the conference center or it would have been excessively dangerous to drive home.</p>
<p>	The red in my left eye is starting to finally go down a bit, but my vision today is overall about the same as yesterday.  This has been pretty concerned.  Everyone says your vision is supposed to be good after one week, which means at this point I'm 5/7th's "done".  With no change between 4/7ths and 5/7ths, my casual projection for where I will be 7 days after surgery is not good.  It seems like my vision won't be improving past the current point.  This means that I will need additional LASIK in both eyes, but I will have to wait two months before I can do that, which means I will need to get new prescription glasses to wear for two months.  Obviously I'm hoping it doesn't come to that, but given the total lack of improvement over the last couple days and the fact that there are only two days left before I can be considered "done healing", my guess is that I won't be happy in two days.</p>
<h2>Day 7</h2>
<p>	The red splotches are really starting to clear up now, which is nice.  Unfortunately, my sight is about the same as the day before.  At this point, a full week later, I have no reason to expect my eyes will be improving any further.  My assumption at this point is that I will need more LASIK.  I'll have to wait a month or so before I can do that, and in the mean time I'll just have to get new glasses or contact lenses.  Because my eyes are so much better than before, I can probably get away with much thinner, more comfortable contact lenses, or a much lighter prescription for glasses.  I have another meeting with the doctor in a few days, but I'm expecting to be told I'll need to wear glasses for a month or so before I can get LASIK again.</p>
<p>	The nice thing about getting LASIK a second time is that they can reuse the flap, so the really unpleasant part (getting the flap cut) won't have to be endured again.  That's good news, but I am extremely disappointed in my results so far.</p>
<h1>Something's Wrong</h1>
<h2>Day 9</h2>
<p>	The doctor made new lenses for my old glasses.  Putting glasses back on after the traumatic surgery experience was very frustrating, but even worse the prescription was too h2 or something.  Wearing the glasses gave me a headache, so I've decided to just go without them.</p>
<p>	The vision still isn't great.  I don't know that the right word is "blurry", but it's... I dunno, weird.  Something looks off whenever I look at objects, but I can't figure out what it is.  Things are even weirder at night.  I know people said that sometimes LASIK patients get "sunbursts" or "halos" at night but this seems extreme.  I'm counting down the days until I can get additional LASIK.  My doctor says that once my eyes have stabilized, we can go back in and do a little more lasering.  He said it's better to undercorrect than overcorrect, because an undercorrection can be amended later on.  I guess that's what I have, but there's just something strange.  Before surgery, when I'd take my glasses off, things would be blurry.  But now, what I have isn't the same kind of blurry.  It's hard to explain, but something's not right.  I'm trying not to panic though, since my doctor says it can be fixed with more surgery, and since the flaps are already cut the subsequent surgery's should be less intense.</p>
<h2>Week 3</h2>
<p>	I finally figured out why things look strange.  I was driving to work and in front of me was a white pickup truck with the word CHEVROLET emblazoned on the back in huge letters.  The letters were outline-style, providing an extremely high contrast image.  While looking at this logo, I realized that I saw the word CHEVOLET twice, one slightly above the other.  The rest of the day, I looked at objects and verified that this was the case - everything I looked at, I saw two of, one right above the other and slightly dimmer.  This is why things have been looking so strange since I got the surgery, I'm seeing double.</p>
<p>	That night, I noticed it was even more pronounced.  Traffic lights and headlights had multiple copies of the lights surrounding them.  These weren't halos or starbursts, they were doubles.  I looked at some books and some text on my computer screen - same deal, two copies of all the letters.  No wonder I've been having such a hard time watching movies or reading books.  I have another followup appointment with the doctor soon, hopefully he can make some sense of this.</p>
<h2>Week 4</h2>
<p>	I told my doctor about the doubles.  I spent some time in Photoshop making an approximation of what I was seeing since I had such a hard time explaining it.</p>
<p>	Here is what I see during the day:</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/vision_day.png"><img src="assets/vision_day.png" alt="" title="vision_day" width="640" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893" /></a></p>
<p>	And here is what I see at night:</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/vision_night.png"><img src="assets/vision_night.png" alt="" title="vision_night" width="640" height="495" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894" /></a></p>
<p>	If it's REALLY dark at night, I'll get even more copies, as many as 10 in my left eye.</p>
<p>	As you might guess, driving at night is extremely dangerous.  It's impossible to tell how far away cars are, since I don't see two headlights on cars, but more like 10 per vehicle.  Looking at black text on a white background on my computer is annoying but tolerable, while looking at white text on a black background is damn-near impossible.  This is a shame, as that was always my preferred way of reading.  I have a bookmarklet called <a href="https://www.readability.com/bookmarklets">Readabiliity</a> that I installed in order to convert any web page with white-on-black text into a page with black-on-white text so that I can still use the internet normally. What a pain.</p>
<p>	He said it didn't seem like anything to worry about.  He said that the flap healed a little strangely on my right eye and that I was getting an ingrowth of extra cells as a result of the flap overlapping.  Once my eyes fully healed, he could go in, lift the flap, and scrape those cells out.  Sounds disgusting, but I'm looking for anything that will help.</p>
<p>	Now it's a waiting game.  I'm just going to have to deal with things looking this way for a while until he can fix my eye.  What's odd is that he says it's the extra cells on the right that could be causing the doubles, but I have similar (though less pronounced) issues with my left eye, which he didn't seem to offer an explanation for.  </p>
<p>	I'm trying hard not to worry, but every day is a struggle.  My brain has to work so hard every day to reinterpret the confusing images my eyes are seeing, I'm completely exhausted when I get home.  Reading books is very difficult, and watching movies in a dark room is frustrating because things get so much worse at night.  I like the fact that I can (mostly) see alright without glasses, but at this point I'm definitely wishing I could just undo this whole operation and go back to glasses.</p>
<p>	The really frustrating thing is that I wish I had stuck to my original plan and done one eye at a time.  If I could just close one eye and get relief from the headache-inducing images I see constantly, this would be so much easier to cope with.  But as it is, I see doubles (triples at night) all the time.  There's never a break, there is never relief.  It's a waking nightmare from which there is no escape, and I kick myself constantly for letting myself be talked into doing both eyes at once.  I'm fighting depression constantly.  This sucks.</p>
<p>	I knew there was the potential for complications and I saw lists of all the possible long-term effects LASIK could have.  But whenever side effects were discussed it was like there's a potential for infection, there's a potential for blindness, there's a potential for blurry vision.  I didn't expect this whole "double vision" thing.</p>
<p>	<em>Note: At this point in my history, I realized that this blog post was too long for anyone to ever read it, so I abandoned it.  My growing depression over the entire experience sapped my motivation to keep writing it, and the lack of any sort of resolution made it unworthy of publication.  It wasn't until months later that I decided it would be better to have a record of these events so that I could accurately split them into many blog posts, at which point I decided to go back and add the rest of the entries that follow.  The events are constructed to the best of my memory, and they not only recount events, but my internal thoughts and feelings at the time, without foreknowledge of what followed them.  I used my archived Google Calendar to accurately represent dates, which are all relative to the day of the original LASIK procedure.</em></p>
<h2>Day 56</h2>
<p>	Had my "scraping" surgery today.  It was nowhere near as traumatic as the first LASIK.  Even though I sat in the same LASIK chair and all of that, there was no apparatus to suck my eyeball up and cut a flap like last time, which was the worst part.</p>
<p>	We only did my right eye.  I've learned from my mistake with doing both eyes at once, and since my right eye is worse than my left eye we're going to focus on getting my right eye fixed.  Once that's fixed, we can address my left eye.</p>
<p>	I can tell my doctor feels bad for what's happening to me, he seems to really sympathize, which is nice.  At the same time, I can't help but be a little frustrated with him.  I really wish I hadn't let him convince me to do both eyes at once, and he doesn't really seem to know what to do.  He says it's these cells, but he doesn't exude the same confidence he did when I first started seeing him.  I really hope this works so I can get my vision back to normal and put this nightmare behind me.</p>
<h2>Day 57</h2>
<p>	Followup exam today.  No improvement, but my doctor says to give it some time since my eyes are healing and changing all the time.</p>
<h2>Day 77</h2>
<p>	Another exam today.  The "cell scraping" thing seems to have had absolutely no effect whatsoever.  My doctor is now claiming that the reason is that I still have some leftover astigmatism on my right eye.</p>
<p>	I'm suspicious at this point.  I know what astigmatism looks like in my eyes.  It looks blurry.  I live with blurry for 20 years.  This isn't blurry.  This is doubles.  Two crystal-clear images, neither of which are blurry, layered on top of each other during the day (and more all over the place at night.  The doc seems like he's taking shots in the dark.</p>
<p>	Again we'll have to wait a few months for my eyes to fully heal, but he wants to do more LASIK.  He things that additional correction will fix the doubles.  Again, we're only talking about my right eye, but my left eye isn't that much better.  More waiting game.</p>
<h2>Day 87</h2>
<p>	Yesterday my wife and I went to her little brother's college to watch a football game.  We had nosebleed seats, and at one point she tried to point out a particular player to me.  She pointed at where he was on the sidelines and told me his name, but I couldn't find him.  The letters were small enough that I couldn't make sense of the doubles I was seeing, and I couldn't read any names.  I know I could have read those names if I still had glasses and had never done the LASIK.</p>
<p>	On the ride home (my wife was driving, as it's too dangerous for me to drive at night because of how many copies of headlights I see), my situation really hit me.  I realized that it might never be better than this.  My vision may be stuck this way for the rest of my life.  All I could do was be furious that I did both eyes at once.  Just the thought of closing one eye and getting a break from all of this was too much for me to bear.  I cried the whole way home.  God, I wish I had never done this.</p>
<h2>Day 91</h2>
<p>	Another eye appointment.  This time we've scheduled more LASIK in the right eye for next week.  If this doesn't fix me, I don't know what I'll do.</p>
<p>	The nice thing is that my doctor's LASIK package includes however many followup visits are needed until I'm happy with my vision for up to a year.  So if I have to have 20 surgeries, he'll do that.  That's nice I suppose, though I'm kind of wondering how many surgeries my eye can handle before it melts or something.</p>
<p>	My wife is very unhappy with the doctor.  She's stopped accompanying me on visits because she's mad at him.  I imagine if I had to watch her go through the same thing, I'd be mad at her doctor as well.  He seems like such a nice guy though, I have a hard time blaming him for this.  I mean, they say that the chances of something going wrong are like 1 in 10,000 or something.  Someone has to be the unlucky schmuck who something terrible happens to.  Maybe that's just me.</p>
<p>	In any case, I have a full-blown LASIK for the right eye scheduled next week.  My wife things I should see another doctor, but every visit with my current one is free and paid for, so I'm reluctant.  If this next procedure doesn't help me, I'll start looking for other doctors.</p>
<h2>Day 98</h2>
<p>	More LASIK in the right eye.  I got the doctor to let me take three Valium this time since I was still freaking out the first time on two.  The procedure was much faster this time, and since it didn't involve the eye-sucking apparatus it was less physically traumatizing.</p>
<p>	At this same time, it was more emotionally difficult.  This felt like a real "last chance" kind of situation.  God I hope it works.</p>
<p>	Same deal as the first time.  Came home, layed down, slept for hours and hours.</p>
<h2>Day 99</h2>
<p>	No improvement yet.</p>
<h2>Day 102</h2>
<p>	Okay.  Screw it.  I need to see another doctor.  Nothing is improved at all, everything is the same.  I don't think my doctor has any idea what's wrong or what we can do about it.</p>
<p>	My wife is going to talk to her eye doctor cousin, who went to Wills Eye Institute.  Hopefully he can recommend someone out here in Colorado, but we're also going to see someone AT Wills Eye when we're visiting my sister for Thanksgiving (she lives in PA).</p>
<h1>A Second Opinion</h1>
<h2>Day 124</h2>
<p>	On a web forum I visit regularly, someone asked "How many of you have had Lasik? How much did it cost? Was it worth it?."  I don't often post to the forum, but I felt compelled to reply.  Here is what I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dskzh/how_many_of_you_have_had_lasik_how_much_did_it/c12m1oa">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
	Having Lasik was the biggest mistake of my life, bar-none. I'd give anything to go back to glasses.</p>
<p>	My Lasik did not go well. I currently have triple vision in my left eye and double vision in my right eye, and my doctor doesn't seem to know how to fix it. I'm in the process of consulting additional doctors, but so far nobody is sure of how to make the extra images go away.</p>
<p>	I had the procedure about 6 months ago, and I sometimes can't sleep at night, just full of anxiety about the possibility that I may never be able to get my eyes fixed and I'll have to live with it. There's never a break from my vision problems now, and glasses cannot correct it. Every time I use my eyes, I see multiple copies of everything, even more at night. The only respite is to close my eyes and look at nothing. It's hell.</p>
<p>	If you do Lasik, please, please take this piece of advice... it's something I was planning on doing but then I was talked out of it by my doctor and I get nauseated just thinking about what a colossal mistake it was: DO ONE EYE AT A TIME.</p>
<p>	If I had either eye just be back the way it was before my surgery, if I could just close one eye and see only one of anything, just to have a break from the never-ending, headache-inducing hell that is my current vision, it would be so much easier to cope with how poorly the surgery went.</p>
<p>	Good luck.

<h2>Day 125</h2>
<p>	First appointment with another doctor today, a Dr. Davidson.  He's a Wills Eye grad who knows Julia's cousin from med school.  He's in downtown Denver, which is a bit of a drive, but I'm willing to try anything.  I had my surgeon send over all of my records, and apparently the two of them chatted about my situation via the phone.</p>
<p>	At one point, Dr. Davidson mentioned "the free cap you got."  The what?  He looked perplexed.  "He didn't tell you about the free cap?" Davidson asked. Nope.</p>
<p>	Apparently when my right eye was pulled up to cut the flap in my eye, the laser went straight through.  Normally the laser leaves a small hinge so that the flap can be put back in exactly the same spot, but in my case the laser cut straight through, leaving the flap completely free floating.  This was, according to Davidson, due to the fact that my eyes are somewhat more "conic" shaped than is typically, so the laser was cutting through a smaller area than normal.  As a result, my flap was only 5mm in diameter, rather than the full 9-10mm that a LASIK treatment typically gets (6mm in my left eye).</p>
<p>	This explains a lot.  It explains why I had an "overlap" of cells that had to be scraped off on my right eye.  It's because my surgeon had to place the flap back in the proper spot by hand, since there was no hinge to help with placement.  As a result, it wasn't put back EXACTLY in the same place, leaving an overlap that caused an outgrowth of cells.  Most importantly, it explained why I had to wear the contact lens on my eye eye.  My doctor said that was because it got "scratched" but it was actually to hold my completely free flap in place.  This is the first I heard of this, and apparently my doctor shared it with Davidson freely.  </p>
<p>	Because the flap was so small, the area that was treated was much smaller than usual, meaning I have a treated area in the middle of my eye surrounded by a completely untreated area on the rim.  Davidson says that I have abnormally large pupils, my eyes are probably pulling in some of the light through this untreated area during the day, and even more at night since my pupils expand.  This explains why my vision is bad during the day but so much worse at night.</p>
<p>	Davidson is of the opinion that we could actually do PRK surgery on TOP of the existing LASIK surgery that has been done.  This would allow me to get the full treatment, which would clean up the nighttime issues.  On top of that, the very act of doing PRK would require scraping about 100 microns of cells off the top of my eyeball, which might contain some of the bumps that are causing additional daytime issues.</p>
<p>	For the first time, things are sounding hopeful.  But I want more opinions, so I plan on seeing three more doctors.</p>
<h2>Day 126</h2>
<p>	I had an appointment with my original eye surgeon today.  I had a weird opportunity to compare this visit with the one with Davidson just the day prior.  Davidson seemed so confident, so sure of what was going on and what might fix it.  My original surgeon was not.  </p>
<p>	I ran Davidson's idea by him.  I mentioned the free cap, and he confirmed that it happened.  Why didn't he mention that sooner?</p>
<p>	I asked if my treatment area was small, and he told me it was not.  He said it was large enough, and he dismissed the notion that untreated area on the outer rim of my cornea was the problem.  I asked if he thought PRK would help and he literally shrugged his shoulders and said "it couldn't hurt, we could try it."  We could try it?  Not a confidence-builder.</p>
<p>	He suggested instead that we do more LASIK.  I'm reluctant.  I've sat in the chair three times for this guy and my vision still sucks, I'm not sure I want him touching my eyeballs anymore at all.</p>
<p>	He also wants to try gas-permeable contact lenses.  He said that the pressure the lens puts on my eye my flatten it a bit, smoothing out some of the bumps in the surface of my cornea and helping with the double vision.  Contact lenses?  Argh, I hate contact lenses.  Before surgery, the only way I could see clearly was either glasses or contact lenses.  After surgery, the only way to see clearly is with contact lenses, because glasses can't help. Does that mean I'm actually worse off?  This sucks.</p>
<p>	I made an appointment with his contact lens specialist to give it a shot.  At this point, the most hopeful I've been is with Dr. Davidson.  Contact lenses just won't be an option for me long-term.</p>
<h2>Day 132</h2>
<p>	Appointment with another doctor, Dr. Kumar, today.  This one was depressing.  </p>
<p>	Kumar mentioned (completely independently and with no prodding by me) that my flap seemed small and it was probably contributing to my night vision issues.  He also said I have lots of imperfections on the surface of the eye.</p>
<p>	I asked if he thought PRK could fix it, and he told me it wouldn't.  He said the only thing that could fix it is called "topographically guided surgery" and it's not FDA-approved.  I'd have to go to Canada.  That sounds terrifying to me (not Canada, just doing surgery that isn't approved by the FDA).</p>
<p>	Very depressing day.  Not much else to say, feeling pretty hopeless.  I keep telling myself that Dr. Kumar is younger and less experienced than Dr. Davidson, so I should trust Davidson more, but it's tough to be told there's nothing that can be done for me.</p>
<h2>Day 139</h2>
<p>	Had my contact lens fitting with my surgeon's contact lens guy.  It was torture, even that guy (a contact lens specialist) had a hard time getting lenses in and out of my eyes.  My eyes just don't like contacts.</p>
<p>	The contact lenses tried were called <a href="http://www.lasikcontactlenses.com/">SynergEyes</a>, and the web site for them starts out like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>If you are Depressed or Suicidal due to LASIK, there may be help</h2>
<p>	Perhaps eight to ten million people in the United states have had LASIK eye surgery. Of these, the LASIK industry estimates about five percent are unhappy with their post-LASIK vision, or about 400,000 people (critics of the LASIK industry put the number at many more). If you are depressed or experiencing suicidal thoughts due to severe ocular complications resulting from LASIK and/or other refractive surgical procedures (including multiple procedures), such as dry eye syndrome, starbursting, halos, glare, double vision, ghosting and so on, there may be help. Many post-refractive surgical patients have experienced significant improvement in their vision and comfort with the use of specialty contact lenses including scleral and hybrid lens technologies.
	</p></blockquote>
<p>	Well that just feels great.</p>
<p>	In any case, they didn't help.  Huge waste of time.</p>
<h2>Day 145</h2>
<p>	Today I had an appointment with Dr. Kent, another Wills Eye person.  This was the last appointment I scheduled with a doctor in Colorado.  At this point, I have two opinions (other than my original surgeon, whose opinion is that nothing is wrong I guess).  One, Dr. Davidson, says PRK will help me.  The other, Dr. Kumar, says it's hopeless.  I'm hoping that Dr. Kent comes down in one of these two camps, and in particular I'm hoping she agrees with Dr. Davidson.</p>
<p>	The appointment went the same as the rest.  She said my flaps looked very small, surprise surprise.  She also said she's not really an expert in laser eye surgery, but that she knows someone who is absolutely one of the best in that area and she can recommend him.  I asked his name, and she told me "Dr. Davidson"</p>
<p>	Well that settles that.  Davidson is going to become my new doctor.  He was the most positive that I could be fixed, he's the most experienced, and he's now been recommended twice.</p>
<h2>Day 147</h2>
<p>	Another exam with my surgeon.  I don't even know why I'm still going to see him.  I guess I just feel awkward not seeing him anymore, like I somehow owe him the chance to fix my eyes.  But he doesn't seem to have any ideas, it honestly seems like he's just humoring me or something.  Today when I brought up the PRK again he said it might be worth doing "simply because it's something we haven't tried before."  Yikes.</p>
<p>	To be honest, I'm wondering if I should bring a medical malpractice suit against him.  I don't know what all is involved in that, but this seems to have gone beyond the realm of "hey, shit happens in surgery" into the land of "I was completely negligent and it's personally my fault that your eyes are so messed up."  I don't want to clue him in that I'm angry with him, because I'm worried that if he suspects I'm going to sue him he's going to clam up and stop communicating with me.  But at the same time, I've gotten a lot of information from these other doctors, and I want to hear his take.  I use today's appointment to lightly dip my toe into cluing him in that I think he messed up.</p>
<p>	There's something that's bugging me about this whole procedure more than anything else.  Now, when I first expressed concern over the flap-cutting aspect of LASIK, I made sure to ask, if anything goes wrong with the flap cutting, what will we he do?  He said he'd put the flap back, abort, wait a while, and do PRK.  Something went wrong with the flap-cutting (way too small, by about half), but instead of doing what we agreed on, he went ahead.  That really bothers me, but that doesn't bother me as much as something else.</p>
<p>	He got the free cap on my RIGHT eye.  That means that even though, during the surgery, he got immediate feedback that things were not going as planned, he STILL proceeded and did my left eye as well, obtaining similar messed-up results.  At that point, my right eye was a lost-cause since he did the laser with the too-small flap.  But my left eye was completely unaltered.  If he had stopped right there, I'd only have one messed-up eye, not two.  Why did he continue?</p>
<p>	I decided that, during my appointment today, I would ask that question.</p>
<p>	He told me that I'm remembering wrong.  They did the left eye first, which went "fine" and then proceeded to do the right eye, getting the free cap.  I objected, "no, I remember you doing my right eye first."  He told me that my memory was hazy, and that I was on Valium at the time.  He said they <b>always</b> do the left eye first.</p>
<p>	This bugged me the whole way home.  Was I really remembering wrong?  It's nearly half a year after the surgery, it seemed plausible I was remembering incorrectly.  But I wrote the earlier part of this very blog post a mere two days after the surgery, and even then I mentioned that my right eye was done first, before I even knew about any of this free cap business.  But he said they <b>always</b> do the left eye first.  This didn't make any sense.</p>
<p>	So I went home and started looking through the pictures, trying to jog my memory.  My wife had snapped a lot of photos through the window into the operating room, because I asked her to do so in order that my eventual blog post about LASIK would have some pictures.  Then I noticed something strange.</p>
<p>	Here are two images from my surgery.  The first was taken with a camera, while my right eye is clearly being operated on (click through for higher resolution versions).  The second is a freeze-frame of the video that Julia took with my phone while my left eye is being operated on.</p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/right_eye.jpg"><img src="assets/right_eye-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="right_eye" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-912" /></a></p>
<p>	<a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/files/left_eye.jpg"><img src="assets/left_eye-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="left_eye" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-913" /></a></p>
<p>	Notice anything? </p>
<p>	<em>There's a clock on the wall.</em>  You can clearly see that my right eye was operated on at 1:14, while my left eye was operated on at 1:25.</p>
<p>	<b>He lied to me.</b>  How can he possibly sit there and tell me that they <b>always</b> operate on the left eye first, when my very surgery is a counterexample?  Did he intentionally lie to me to cover up the fact that proceeded with my left eye even after getting the free cap in my right?  That's terrible, I can barely stand to think of it.  But if he didn't intentionally lie, it meant HE was remembering incorrectly.  Is it possible that the machine was programmed to do my left eye and then my right eye, but he operated right and then left, therefore applying my left eye's prescription to my right eye and vice versa?  That would be even worse.</p>
<p>	I don't know what to make of all of this.</p>
<h2>Day 167</h2>
<p>	While visiting my sister for Thanksgiving, I stopped by a Wills Eye doctor named Dr. Ayers to see what he had to say.  No big surprises here, my flaps are small.  He seemed more in the camp as Dr. Kumar, saying that the only real solution would be topographical surgery.  That's a bummer, but Dr. Davidson still has hope, so I'm sticking with him.</p>
<h2>Day 187</h2>
<p>	Another exam with my surgeon.  He barely made time for me today.  I heard the nurse tell him in the adjacent room that I was waiting for him five times.  Eventually she pulled me out of the exam room and back into the waiting room because she needed to use the exam room.  When my surgeon finally saw me, he asked me questions as he PASSED BY in the hallway, his foot halfway into another exam room while he talked to me.</p>
<p>	When he finally discussed my situation with me, he took the attitude that I should keep seeing other eye doctors and let him know what they say.  "Maybe they've got some ideas."</p>
<p>	Alright, I'm done with him.  He's clearly given up on me, so I'm giving up on him.</p>
<h1>Attempting A Fix</h1>
<h2>Day 188</h2>
<p>	Another appointment with Dr. Davidson.  I ask him about topographical surgery and he tells me that yes, that would be the best thing overall, but that PRK would be able to offer some improvement, particular with the night vision since it would take my operational area out to the full 9-10mm I was supposed to get.  PRK wouldn't make it difficult to get Topographical surgery later on, so Davidson is of the view that I may as well do the PRK, as it should provide some improvement to make life more tolerable until "Topo" becomes FDA approved.</p>
<p>	He also tells me that, since my eyes are so messed up, PRK will probably be considered "medically necessary" by my insurance, so it may well be covered.  That's great news.</p>
<p>	I also asked what he thought of doing more LASIK instead of PRK, since I already had a flap cut.  He looked stunned for a second and told me he'd h2ly recommend against that.  Because of the free cap I got, he told me, lifting the flap again for any reason would be "extremely dangerous."  Extremely dangerous?  My other surgeon has lifted the flap TWICE since I got the free cap.</p>
<p>	I really wish I had done PRK with Dr. Davidson from the outset.  He seems more knowledgeable, and I trust him a great deal more.  He told me, because of how large my pupils are (above average apparently) he never would have done LASIK for me, he'd have done PRK from the start.  I think my life would be radically different right now if I hadn't gone with my original surgeon, if I'd stuck to my guns about PRK instead of LASIK, and if I'd only done one eye at a time.</p>
<p>	I'm in another holding pattern.  Davidson is basically going to have to take measurements of my eyes every few weeks until they completely stabilize, at which point he can do PRK on my right eye.  My eyes are still changing, and he doesn't want to try and hit a moving target.  Safe, I like it.</p>
<h2>Day 189</h2>
<p>	My co-workers asked me how I'm doing, eyes-wise.  They were very concerned for me before I got the original procedure and they've watched what I've been going through since.  A lot of them were considering getting LASIK as well, and they were waiting to see how my procedure went (most of them have now decided not to do that).</p>
<p>	I told them the whole story, everything that went wrong, and what the various other doctors have said.  They were glad that there's some hope, although they're just as nervous as me about having MORE surgery (I'm not exactly having the best luck in that regard).  </p>
<p>	A few of them suggested I sue my original surgeon.  I hadn't really thought about that.  I mean, I'm pissed off at the guy, but I've never sued anyone before.  I don't even know what all is involved in that.  Don't doctors make mistakes?  I can't just sue someone for messing up, can I?  </p>
<p>	My coworkers pointed out a few elements of my explanation for what happened stand out as particularly sue-worthy.</p>
<ol>
<li>My surgeon never told me about the free cap, though he did know about it (since he's the one who told the other doctors he talked to).  All he told me was that my right eye got "scratched."  Because I didn't know about the free cap, I was not given enough information to make an informed choice about the ingrown-cell-scraping procedure or the second LASIK.  Since another doctor said lifting the flap was dangerous, this was information that shouldn't have been denied to me</li>
<li>During the discussion of the procedure, I explicitly expressed concern about my deep-set eyes making it difficult for the surgeon to get a good flap.  We agreed that, should he be unable to get a good flap, he would put the flap back, let it heal up, and do PRK instead.  During the operation, this scenario played out exactly, in that my surgeon was only able to secure a flap half the diameter that he should have.  Instead of aborting the procedure as we agreed, he continued against our agreement without telling me the flap was small.  Most of my vision issues are related directly to this undersized flap.</li>
<li>The surgeon did my right eye first.  That means that, after he got the free cap on my right eye, he STILL proceeded to do the left eye the same way.  The free cap should have been an indication that my eyes were too conic to get an adequately sized cap, and thus at the very least he should have stopped after one eye and done the left eye PRK-style.  But despite getting feedback IN SURGERY that it wasn't going as planned, he proceeded to do the other eye anyway, once again getting a too-small flap and causing me untold problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>	When I think about things in this way, I'm much angrier at my surgeon.  These things really were awful of him (I'm particularly bothered by #2 since I was so worried about the flap aspect of LASIK to begin with).  I have no idea what's involved with suing someone, but I'm going to look into it.</p>
<h1>PRK Procedure</h1>
<h2>Day 300</h2>
<p>	FINALLY HERE! My eyes stabilized enough that PRK could be done.  Today, Dr. Davidson did the PRK on my right eye only, exactly 300 days after my original procedure.  I cannot believe I've had to live like this for 300 days.  When I show my co-workers those photoshopped images of my vision, they don't even understand how I can do my job.  Honestly, I don't either.  In a way, I've just gotten used to the headaches and confusing visual images and I work around them.  I really hope this procedure fixes my right eye, but even if it does I'll have to wait 6 weeks for my eye to fully stabilize in order to know if the PRK actually helped.  </p>
<p>	As far as the procedure itself, it was very much like the LASIK.  Take some valium, sit down, wait a bit.  Lay down in chair in operating room, start to freak out.  This time my eye was held open by a smaller-looking metal device, and my eyelashes were actually taped down.  This felt weird since, once again, all of the numbing was done on my actual eyeball, not the area surrounding it.</p>
<p>	Davidson squirted some alcohol on the top of my eye in order to loosen the top layer of cells (gross) so they could be easily scraped off.  Hopefully, this layer contains some of the bumps and imperfections that are contributing to my vision problems.  Then I got the laser treatment on my eye.  Davidson told me it would be about 2-3 seconds of treatment, but it wound up being closer to 15.  After that he put a contact lens on my eye and wheeled me out from under the laser.</p>
<p>	I had a little bit of a panic attack when I first got wheeled under, and I had to ask for a second to breathe before they continued.  I think this was largely due to how nervous I was about surgery making my eyes worse, since I have such a crappy history.</p>
<p>	Davidson told me that when he got into my eye, he found that there were even more bumps and imperfections than he originally thought.  He said he was able to clear "about 90%" of them.  I don't know what that means, but it sounds good.  He also said that the machine treated my eye longer than he expected, meaning it was able to treat even more of the outer untreated area than he anticipated.  He also confirmed that I got a full 9mm treatment.  All of this sounds great.</p>
<p>	When I got home, I felt great.  No eye pain whatsoever, I had no idea what people were talking about when they said PRK hurt more.   I took a nap for a couple hours.  When I woke up, I was in intense pain.  Holy shit PRK hurts, you have no idea.  My eye felt like it was on fire.  I went ahead and e-mailed work to say I wasn't going to be in again until Monday.</p>
<p>	Sleeping was hell.  I got maybe 3 hours of total sleep.  The painkiller I was given appeared to have absolutely no effect.  What's crazy to think about is, if this works, I'm going to be eager to do it again for my left eye.  I will absolutely power through this intense pain if it means I could start seeing just one of anything I look at.  I really hope this works.</p>
<h2>Day 301</h2>
<p>	Pain not as bad as yesterday, but still up there.  I'm extremely sensitive to light, and I'm wearing sunglasses around the house most of the time.  It's hard to keep my eyes open while looking at screens or computer monitors, so I'm keeping that to a minimum (largely just using a computer to update this diary).  I find myself falling asleep if I watch any movies or TV.  At this point, I've simply come to accept it and I go ahead and let myself sleep most of the day.</p>
<p>	I got a call back from a law firm that I called yesterday before my surgery.  The paralegal asked me if I had a chronology, and I had no idea what that was.  She said it was a list of events that took place.  Ha, I did actually have one, this very blog post.  I'm going to send it to her.</p>
<h2>Day 302</h2>
<p>	Still sensitive to light, but the pain is basically gone now.  I tried going out to dinner with my wife.  She drove, but as I walked from the car to the restaurant, the setting sun was like a nuclear bomb for my eyes.  I shielded myself from the light like a vampire as she held my hand and guided me into the restaurant.  Really hoping the light sensitivity goes away.</p>
<p>	One of the weird things is, my right eye is less blurry than it was.  When I first had the PRK, the right eye was a blurry mess.  Davidson said this was due to the contact lens, so I thought nothing of it.  But now the right eye is a lot clearer, only slightly blurry.  That makes me think the blurriness wasn't due to the lens, but to the surgery itself, and that it's simply healing.</p>
<p>	That seems like it would be good, except that means the contact lens isn't doing much to impair my vision.  This is unfortunate, because the doubles in the right eye still persist.  I really really hope it's the healing process and the contact lens that are causing the doubles to stick around, but this isn't doing much to boost my confidence.</p>
<p>	I have to keep reminding myself, the PRK was worth doing because it was covered on insurance and offered a CHANCE at improvement.  If it doesn't help, topographical is still an option.  It's going to be a long six weeks.</p>
<h2>Day 303</h2>
<p>	Light sensitivity mostly gone.  I was able to use a computer all day, read, e-mail, code a little.  Life is normal for me again, I just have to take various kinds of eye drops every hour.  Every day I wake up I hope that my right eye is somehow crystal clear and this nightmare can be behind me, but this is wishful thinking.  I need to give it the six weeks, but I imagine that the entry I wind up writing on, what, "Day 345", is going to either be extremely jubilant or extremely depressed.</p>
<h2>Day 308</h2>
<p>	Got my bandage contact lens removed this morning.  Before Dr. Davidson removed the lens, I tried to manage my expectations.</p>
<p>	"Is it possible that you take this lens off, and I still see the doubles, but they get cleared up in 6 weeks?" Yes.</p>
<p>	"Is it possible that you take this lens off, and the doubles are gone, but they come back in 6 weeks?" No.  Oh, that's good.</p>
<p>	He also told me that he actually expected things to be BLURRIER once the lens was off because the lens has a little bit of prescription.  That's funny, I remember him telling me that it had no prescription, so my eyes were going to be pretty blurry after the surgery.  I'm now pretty sure he told me that the lens was causing the blurriness because my eyes were SO blurry immediately after the PRK, and he didn't want me to panic.  I can't fault him for that one, he kind of told me exactly what I needed to hear.</p>
<p>	It was weird.  My eye adjusted so much to the contact lens that I didn't even feel like it was in.  When he removed it, it felt like there WAS something in my eye.  I great deal of the irritation and light sensitivity returned after the lens was removed, and my eye started feeling dry very easily.</p>
<p>	Things were indeed blurrier as he predicted as well.  The really weird thing was the steroid eye drops, which I've been taking to prevent "haze" (whatever the hell that is).  Every time I took one today, it felt like my eye was being squeezed, a sensation I didn't have when the contact was in.  He also told me I could stop taking the antibiotic drops since my epithelial layer had fully healed, which was nice because those are the drops that taste like cement.</p>
<p>	Work was kind of tough.  By 1pm, my eyes were exhausted.  Light sensitive, irritated, and tired.  I was wearing sunglasses while at my computer inside and I looked like a dork, so the rest of my small team put on their sunglasses in solidarity.  I left a bit early to go home and lay down, by 3:00 my eye was pink with irritation and one of my coworkers told me I looked high.</p>
<h2>Day 313</h2>
<p>My eyes fluctuate.  Sometimes things look clear, other times blurry. Yesterday was an extremely blurry day, I don't get it.</p>
<p>I still have doubles, and they are still much worse at night.  It's possible I have even more than I did before the PRK.  It's a daily struggle to remain calm, I have to keep reminding myself that my eyes are changing and I won't know for about 5 more weeks if the procedure worked.  It's tough though, because my eyes don't really seem to be improving slowly or anything, every day seems the same in terms of doubles.</p>
<p>I'm weaning myself off the anti-haze drops.  3 times per day next week, then 2 the next week, and finally once a day two weeks from now.</p>
<h2>Day 342</h2>
<p>My eye is better than they were after the surgery, but not as good as it was before the surgery.  I still have a hard time telling if the doubles are gone because things are blurry, but I'm leaning toward them not being gone yet.  There are still ghosting images everywhere.</p>
<p>The doc was able to hook my up to the "clearer, or smaller and darker" machine and I could read 20/20 pretty well with it.  That's a good sign, it means my eyes will probably heal up to that point over time.  Back to waiting.</p>
