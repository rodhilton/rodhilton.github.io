<p>Android is a great mobile OS for people who like to tinker and customize things.  Virtually every aspect of Google's default Android install can be replaced with something else.  There are a number of alternative SMS clients if you are unhappy with the default, a plethora of alternative Gallery apps, multiple Email replacements, and many more.  You can even replace applications that seem 'core' to the OS such as the dialer and even the <a href="http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/01/28/android-launcher-showdown-launcherpro-adw-zeam-go-launcher-quickdesk/">Home Screen Launcher</a>.</p>
<p>The ability to replace the Launcher opens up a world of possibilites for customization.  Launchers like <a href="http://www.launcherpro.com/">LauncherPro</a> and <a href="http://jbthemes.com/anderweb/category/adwlauncher/">ADW Launcher</a> have tons of options, giving users a lot of control.</p>
<p>One of the features of some of these launchers combines really well with another type of Android app to allow users to solve the problem of cramming too many shortcuts into homescreens.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Android's default launcher, depending on what if you are using vanilla Android, MotoBlur, HTC Sense, or another custom UI layer, offers somewhere between 3 and 9 home screens.  This allows users to place a lot of shortcut icons on their home screens, as well as widgets.  But imagine you are on the leftmost homescreen in a 9-screen layout.  The application you want is on your rightmost homescreen, so you have to move over 8 screens to get to it.  It would be easier to press the "Apps" dock icon to load all of your apps, but then you have to scroll through a huge list of applications, searching for the one you want (which may have moved if you've installed something new since you last looked).</p>
<p>Fortunately, LauncherPro and <a href="http://golauncher.goforandroid.com/">GO Launcher</a> both have a feature called gesture actions.  Gesture actions allow the user to swipe their finger over a dock icon  (press and hold, then move your finger) to launch an action other than the default action of the dock icon.  Gestures can trigger a number of different actions, including launching shortcuts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are programs like <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.rhmsoft.shortcuts&feature=search_result">Smart Shortcuts</a>, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.code.appsorganizer&feature=search_result">Apps Organizer</a>, and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.th.android.widget.SiMiFolder&feature=search_result">Simi Folder Widget</a>.  These applications allow you to create groups of other apps and categorize them.  You can then pop up one of these groups as a shortcut action, which means you can bind it to a dock icon's gesture.</p>
<p>My personal preference is to use LauncherPro with Smart Shortcuts.  Smart Shortcuts allows you to make a lot of different types of shortcut groups (which can then have other shortcut groups in them if you want) so you have a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>Open Smart Shortcuts and create an Application Shortcut.  I'm calling mine "Communication".</p>
<p><img src="assets/20110810193730-168x300.png" alt="" title="20110810193730" width="168" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1352" /></p>
<p>Notice that I'm also making "Phone" a favorite.  This is because the dock icon I am adding this gesture action to is the one for Phone.  By marking Phone as a favorite (and making sure it's the only one) it will be sorted to the beginning of the list when the folder pops up.  I do this for each dock icon so that if I accidentally swipe instead of press a dock icon, the top left element will be the application I wanted.</p>
<p><img src="assets/201108101831381-168x300.png" alt="" title="20110810183138" width="168" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1366" /></p>
<p>Now, back on the home screen I long-press my phone shortcut in the bottom left and select "Swipe gesture action".  I then select "Launch shortcut" and finally "Smart Shortcuts".</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1361" align="aligncenter" width="580" caption="Adding the Swipe Gesture action"]<img src="assets/shortcut_process-580x247.png" alt="" title="Shortcut Process" width="580" height="247" class="size-large wp-image-1361" />[/caption]</p>
<p>Then I simply select my "Communication" group I created before.  Now, no matter which home screen I'm on, I can swipe the Phone icon and get all of my Communication-related applications.</p>
<p><img src="assets/20110810183111-168x300.png" alt="" title="20110810183111" width="168" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1364" /></p>
<p>Pressing the screen anywhere other than an icon dismisses the pop-up, and the size of the box expands when you add more applications.</p>
<p>You can also use Smart Shortcuts to do things like making it so swiping your Contacts dock icon brings up a list with your Contacts that are marked as Favorites, or add things other than applications to your shortcut folders, such as other shortcut folders, bookmarks, etc.</p>
<p>Simi Folder Widget allows you to do the same thing, but with a somewhat nicer-looking interface.  I found it too slow and occasionally buggy (it always crashed LauncherPro on the first launch of any new Folder Widget), and I found Smart Shortcuts to be better overall, but there are lots of combinations of apps that allow for this functionality.</p>
<p>I was able to move virtually all of my homescreen icons into categories which I attached to swipe actions, allowing me to reduce my number of homescreens to 3.  Having only 3 screens, all of which are pretty lightly loaded, seems to have made the process of returning to my home screen quite a bit snappier, and I never have to switch home screens to get to the applications I use a lot.  LauncherPro even allows you to add a swipe gesture to the middle "Open/Close Drawer" action, so I put my most commonly used applications there.</p>
