<p>I've been a <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Redditor</a> for a while.  I realize that communities like Reddit and 4chan constantly have older folks lamenting the loss in quality of their respective sites, but I feel like with Reddit it really is true.  When I first started using reddit, it was all links to articles, blogs, and other interesting things worth reading or watching.  The discussions in the comments were usually quite thought-provoking, and it was a great way to both pass the time as well as learn.  </p>
<p><img src="assets/Screen-shot-2011-11-10-at-9.42.09-AM-300x214.png" alt="" title="Redditor" width="300" height="214" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1723" /></p>
<p>Today it is overrun by stupidity.  <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-comics">Rage Comics</a> and <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/advice-animals">Advice Animals</a> completely overrun nearly every subreddit.  Occasionally these image macros and comics are funny, but 99% of the time they are idiotic.  Repeated attempts to move this unfunny garbage into their own subreddits have met with failure.  Because images are so quick to read, people view and upvote them more easily than real articles, which gives Karma whores incentive to post (and repost) more of them.</p>
<p>At the core of Reddit is a community of intelligent individuals, thought-provoking links, and genuine insight, but it's now surrounded by loud, obnoxious, unfunny nonsense.  Rather than give up on the site, I have embraced tools and devised some systems that allow me to continue using Reddit without wanting to reach into the internet and punch it in the face.  Knowing that it risks ruining these systems, I've decided to share them here.</p>
<p>First, you will need to make an account.  If you're a pure lurker with no reddit account, I can't help you.  You will need your own account to make reddit tolerable.</p>
<h1>Unsubscribe from all frontpage subreddits</h1>
<p>By far, the worst parts of reddit are all right up front.  When you hit the front page without an account, there are a number of subreddits at the top.  These are the most popular subreddits on the site, which means they are the most attractive to karma whores.  Though these subreddits occasionally have good content, the overwhelming majority of it is unfunny image macros and reposts.  Anything truly excellent will be reposted elsewhere.   The first step is to unsubscribe from every single one of them.</p>
<p>As it happens, every one of these subreddits has a replacement subreddit (or set of subreddits) that is not on the front page, and therefore much better.  Subscribe to those instead.</p>
<p>Here are the subreddits currently on the front page as of the time of this post, and which subreddits to subscribe to in order to replace them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/r/pics</strong> - /r/pics is a cesspool of idiocy.  The problem here is that there's no topic for /r/pics.  The only thing in common with all the links are that they are pictures.  This isn't a content-based similarity, but a format-based one.  Are they supposed to be funny pictures? Pretty pictures?  Sexy pictures?  Nobody knows, so it's just a potpourri of crap.  A huge number of the pictures posted these days are actually multiple frames of a video clip, with the words of the video clip overlayed on top of each frame.  Why would someone transcribe a video to a picture and post it to pics, you ask?  Because /r/pics has over a million subscribers, and /r/videos only has 600,000!  Instead, figure out what <b>kind</b> of pictures you like looking at.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/comics">Comics</a>?  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/photography">Photography</a>?  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/">Cool pictures of nature</a>?  Each of those has a devoted subreddit, so replace /r/pics with content-based picture subreddits that you find interesting.</li>
<li><b>/r/funny</b> - This entire subreddit is just reposts.  Unsubscribe and never look back.  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/jokes">/r/jokes</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/humor">/r/humor</a> are vastly superior.  /r/funny is mostly just pictures, and they're all pretty terrible.</li>
<li><b>/r/politics</b> - The hivemind is stronger in /r/politics than anywhere else on reddit.  The question to ask yourself is, why are you interested in politics?  Are you trying to keep up with current events or do you just like to be informed about stuff that matters for your particular political persuasion?  If it's the former, /r/worldnews is a better bet (despite being a frontpage subreddit, nobody reads it so it's safe).  If it's the latter, join the subreddit for your political party, such as /r/democrats or /r/republicans. </li>
<li><b>/r/gaming</b> - Hey guys!  Does anyone remember this extremely popular game from about 10 years ago!  Upvote if you played this game and enjoyed it!  Replace with /r/gamernews, /r/truegaming, and /r/ludology.</li>
<li><b>/r/AskReddit</b> and <b>/r/worldnews<b> - These subreddits are moderated well enough that they're okay.  I'm still subscribed to both.</b></b></li>
<li>><b>/r/videos</b> - Just like /r/pics, there is no common thread to the content of these videos.  Just unsubscribe, you lose nothing.  Videos about the topics you're interested in will be posted to the subreddits for those topics.</li>
<li><b>/r/atheism</b> - Replace with /r/skeptic, /r/freethought, and /r/science</li>
<li><b>/r/technology</b> - Replace with the actual technologies you are interested in. Android? Apple? Linux? Security?  Whatever.</li>
<li><b>/r/programming</b> - This isn't on the front page anymore, but it's still full of kids that hear something like "design pattern" and get their underoos in a wad about it.  Replace with language-specific subreddits.
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use RES</h1>
<p>Use the RES custom bar to create 'groups' that combine with the multi-subreddit feature.</p>
<p>Use filterreddit to block quickmeme, qck.me, and imgur.com from every subreddit except /r/pics,   </p>
