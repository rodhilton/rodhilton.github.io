<p>A year ago, I <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2006/12/30/my-interview-with-google/">interviewed with Google</a>.  Google has been my ideal employer for a while, and I greatly appreciated the opportunity and enjoyed the experience.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my algorithm skills were not quite up to par.  I was told to work on them and interview again in a year.  Based on my own analysis of how well I did with the questions, I walked away from the experience with the impression that I was very close to getting the job, but not quite up to snuff. </p>
<p>When I had applied to Google in the first place, my attitude was that I probably wasn't good enough for Google and I would send my resume along just to "see what happens."  After coming within inches of the job, I realized that <strong>I actually was good enough for Google (or at least, almost good enough)</strong>.  Discovering I was almost good enough for my dream job gave me a great deal of motivation to improve and try again.</p>
<p>The year following this experience was <em>All About Google</em>.  I left my job to take a new job that I felt would help make me a better candidate at Google.  I began doing <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> sessions in my spare time.  I took on some extra projects.  I purchased and read a number of books to help me become a better engineer, and I focused specifically on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Pearls-2nd-ACM-Press/dp/0201657880">books</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693">about</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Foundations-Analysis-Internet/dp/0471383651">algorithms</a>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>The past year has kept me focused, laser-sighted, on a second interview with Google.  The plan was to be so well-prepared for the second interview that I'd obliterate it and speed right through to my new desk at Google.</p>
<p>One year and seven months after my first interview, in July of 2008, I sent my resume along.  I talked with a recruiter, who told me my resume looked good and she'd submit it for me.</p>
<p>A few days later, what happened?  I got my first phone screen interview?  I nailed the phone screen and went to the in-person interview?  I got the job?</p>
<p>No.  <strong>I was denied by the pre-screener</strong>.  I didn't even get a phone interview.</p>
<p>A year ago, I made it through the pre-screening, the first phone interview, and the second phone interview.  I did well in the all-day in-person interview, but not quite well enough.  Since that time I've only improved my skills, gained more experience, and bettered myself as a programmer and a job candidate.  Yet, my efforts didn't even result in a single interview.</p>
<p><em>What happened?</em></p>
<p>I've been mulling over this, trying to determine what resulted in such a <strong>dramatic change between my experiences</strong>.  Considering that my resume was the only thing the pre-screener looked at, it seemed the likely culprit.</p>
<p><img src="assets/notyours_small1.jpg" alt="Me, fail" class="alignright" /></p>
<p>The main difference between my resume a year ago and my resume today was that I had an extra job on it.  The only thing I can imagine hurting me was the fact that I have been doing Ruby on Rails professionally at my current job, and Google uses mostly Java.</p>
<p>The only thing other than my resume that could have possibly changed between last year and this year is Google itself.  I did some research, and discovered a lot of internet buzz about a '<a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2008/4/google_hiring_freeze_"><strong>hiring freeze</strong></a>'.  Google still has job postings all over the place, so it seems weird to me that they'd be in an actual freeze, but my buddy <a href="http://www.blahstuff.com">Jake</a> suggests that maybe they've entered into "<strong>genius only mode</strong>".</p>
<p>My best guess is that it's a combination of these two factors.  <strong>Google is being far more discerning about candidates than they were a year ago, and I wasn't as great a fit because I haven't done Java in a year</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm still trying to decide if I want to try again in a year.  Part of me still considers a job with Google to be my dream job, but what I realized was that planning my life around Google for a year led to crushing disappointment.  At this point, I'm not even thinking about applying again.</p>
<p>Devoting the last year to the narrow focus of Google employment was a tremendous mistake.  This is not to say that all of the training itself was worthless.<strong>  I am a far better programmer today than I was a year ago</strong>.  I can solve more complex problems with greater ease, and I have an improved grasp on engineering topics.  TopCoder has been fun, and I believe I will continue doing it even though it didn't help me land the Google job.  All of the books I've read are highly recommended.  Looking back, I wish I had done those things for me instead of for Google, which is why I won't make the same mistake again.</p>
<p>Moving forward,<em> I will continue to improve my skills, but I will do so for myself</em>, the way I used to before I got caught up in all of this Google business.  I'm removing 'Get a job at Google' from my life goal list on 43things, not because I don't still want to work there, but because I don't still want to let that goal consume my life.  If I decide to apply to Google again, it will be on a whim, rather than some kind of carefully planned training program.</p>
<p>We'll see what happens.</p>
