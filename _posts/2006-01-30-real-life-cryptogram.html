<p><a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/handwritten_rea.html">This</a> is neat.  Allegedly, it's an unsolved cryptogram from a suicide note.</p>
<p>In reality, it's part of a chain letter and it's probably a hoax.  Even if it's a chain letter, though, it's a pretty neat chain letter.</p>
