<p>DISCLAIMER: No, I am not going to send you any invites to anything.  This post is here for informational purposes only, I do not condone any kind of piracy.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I participated in a large number of private torrent tracker sites.  One thing I always heard was: "how can I increase my ratio?"</p>
<p>If you are a member of a private tracker site, you know that one of the hardest things to do is increase your ratio easily.  Many private trackers ban you for dropping below a specific ratio, but very often people find that when they download a torrent, nobody else seems to request those torrents afterwards, leaving the ratio of that torrent at 0.0 (you can't upload what nobody else wants).</p>
<p>Obviously, the best way to increase your ratio is to upload, but most people who are new to a private tracker aren't comfortable uploading, or find that they have no content that they can contribute.  So the question remains: "how do I increase my ratio without uploading something new?"</p>
