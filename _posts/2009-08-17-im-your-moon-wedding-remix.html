<p>After I proposed to my girlfriend, I was tasked with finding a good first dance song for us.  This was not easy, as I typically listen to hard rock, with occasional smatterings of other genres.</p>
<p>I got quite lucky, however, when I went through my one of these other genres, my Jonathan Coulton folder, and found a song called <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/08/25/thing-a-week-47-im-your-moon/">I'm Your Moon</a>.</p>
<p>It's a super geeky little song about Pluto and it's moon, Charon.  The chorus goes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I'm your moon,<br />
you're my moon,<br />
we go round and round.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway, we both really liked this song because it was kind of nerdy and had a double meaning (to someone unaware of the science, it just sounds like a nice love song).</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there's part of the song (after the second chorus) where the beat completely drops out.  This makes it very difficult to dance to.  Additionally, we weren't crazy about the lyrics for this section of the song, as they were a bit too dark.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Who you were<br />
Long before<br />
They said you were<br />
No more
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously this is about Pluto being downgraded from "Planet" status, but since a lot of the attendees weren't going to know that the song has anything to do with planets, we decided to cut this section of the song out.</p>
<p>Since Coulton released this song under<a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Jonathon_Coulton"> Creative Commons </a>, I've decided to share my edited version of the song.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.zshare.net/audio/633601952fb5bc99/">Enjoy!</a></p>
