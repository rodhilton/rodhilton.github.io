<p>There have been a number of blog posts and discussions lately around the evils of agile.  Lots of traffic recently surrounding an <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/2006/06/07/agile-people-still-dont-get-it/">old post by Cedric</a>.  This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3226711/giving-up-agile-switching-to-waterfall-is-this-right">stackoverflowist</a> is switching to waterfall.  Hell, agile ruined <a href="http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2010/09/agile-ruined-my.php">this guy&#8217;s life</a> &#8211; <strong>HIS ENTIRE LIFE</strong>!</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of agile software development, which should come as no surprise given that I work at Rally.  But honestly, I understand where all of this backlash is coming from.  Whenever someone has come to me and told me &#8220;this is the way you will do things now,&#8221; then decreed some elaborate, formal process I would have to follow, I&#8217;ve resented it.  Don&#8217;t tell me how to work.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of people who are annoyed at agile lately are confusing <strong>Agile</strong> with <strong>agile</strong>.</p>
