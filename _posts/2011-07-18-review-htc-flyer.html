<p>Despite my general <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/03/30/review-viewsonic-gtablet/">lack of interest in tablets</a>, I've had my eye on the <a href="http://www.htc.com/www/product/flyer/overviewa.html">HTC Flyer</a> since it was announced in April.</p>
<p>The Flyer is a 7" tablet, smaller than the more popular trend of 10" tablets such as the iPad or the Xoom, and it has one particularly distinguishing feature: a capacitive pen that allows for drawing in the tablet's software.</p>
<p>Knowing that I was going back to school in the Fall, I wondered if the Flyer would work as a note-taking device.  Well, I was actually given the Flyer for my birthday in July and I've spent a good week with it, using it to take notes at <a href="http://uberconf.com/conference/denver/2011/07/home">UberConf</a>.  Here are my thoughts on the device.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h1>The Hardware</h1>
<p>The tablet feels sturdy, though the battery compartment feels a little loose.  Since the compartment wraps around the edge of the tablet, your hands wind up grabbing the tablet by the battery compartment, which jiggles slightly and makes the experience feel a tad cheap.  I solved this by picking up a <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Rocketfish&%23153%3B+Mobile+-+Hard+Shell+Case+for+HTC+Flyer+Tablet+-+Black/2732121.p?id=1218346761943&skuId=2732121">hard shell for the Flyer</a>, which substantially improved the experience.</p>
<p>I initially worried that 7" might be too small for a Tablet, but after playing around with a Xoom and an iPad for a while, I actually found them to be somewhat clunky to work with, so large that they pretty much required two hands to use.  The smaller form-factor of the Flyer makes it ideal for holding with two hands, but also possible to hold and use in one hand (to be fair, I have somewhat large hands).  <strong>I actually found the size of the Flyer to be ideal</strong>: it's just barely small enough to be held in portrait mode by one hand, and no smaller.</p>
<p>The processor is more than enough to handle anything I've thrown at it.  I've found that animations and general interaction are even smoother than the Flyer than the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/xoom-android-tablet/us-en/overview.html">Motorola Xoom</a>, despite the fact that the Xoom has a dual core processor (the Xoom uses a dual-core 1GHz processor while the Flyer uses a single-core 1.5Ghz processor).</p>
<p>The Flyer is pretty light, a little over half the weight of the Xoom, though it still feels a <b>tad</b> heavier than it ought to, especially with the hard shell added.  </p>
<p>It's also equipped with both front and rear cameras, unlike the Gtablet, but similar to the Xoom.  I have not tried any sort of video conferencing with the device, but I'm sure its fine.  <strong>The built-in microphone, however, is unimaginably terrible</strong>, but more on that later.</p>
<p>The battery life is phenomenal.  <strong>I get about 6 hours of constant use, and when I say constant use, I mean that literally.</strong>  The screen is set to timeout after 1 minute of inactivity, and it didn't time out once during the entire 6 hours because I was interacting with the device on a nonstop basis.  I need the device for class, so the worst case scenario is 3 classes back-to-back, which would be about 5 hours of constant use.  My MacBook Pro, by contrast, with similarly constant use lasts about 3 hours.</p>
<p>The standard Android buttons (Home, Menu, Back, none of that stupid Search button nonsense) are on the side of the Flyer, but interestingly enough when the device is rotated, the buttons actually "move" so that the lit-up version of the buttons are always on the bottom.  Interestingly, the device can only be rotated two ways: the front-camera on the right side, or the front-camera on the top.  Rotating to any other orientation doesn't even cause the software to rotate the screen, nor does it move the hardware buttons.  This is particularly worth mentioning in case you're interested in the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Rocketfish%26%23153%3B+Mobile+-+Folio+Case+for+HTC+Flyer+Tablet+-+Black/2732088.p?id=1218346760255&skuId=2732088">RocketFish Folio Case</a> for the Flyer, because the folio is designed to place the camera on the bottom when the folio is used as a stand, making it <b>completely upside-down and unusable</b>.  Avoid that case.</p>
<h1>The Software</h1>
<p>The Flyer runs Android, which is great for me because I'm a complete <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2009/11/06/verizon-droid-vs-t-mobile-g1/">Android fanboy</a>.  It also runs a special version of HTC Sense, HTC's own layer of software on top of Android.  Overall, I found HTC Sense pretty unobjectionable, it's easily <strong>the best of the manufacturer-specific Android flavors I've worked with</strong> (MotoBlur being, by far, the worst).  It has a number of cool widgets, with a lot of built-in stress on social.</p>
<p>Most importantly (for me) is the built-in Notes application, created specifically for the Flyer.  The Notes app lets you create new notes using the on-screen keyboard, but you can also whip out the special pen and draw right on the note.  No separate "pen mode" or anything like that, you just write directly on the virtual pad of paper.  Notes continue scrolling forever, so you never need to create a new page or anything like that, making notetaking a very fluid experience.  The application also allows you to record audio, attach files, and even take pictures with the built-in camera (which are inserted inline into your note).  Best of all, <b>it automatically syncs these notes with your <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> account</b>.</p>
<p>A lot of people were annoyed when the Flyer was released because it cost as much as a Xoom (not quite, actually), but did not run Honeycomb.  While it would be nice of the Flyer ran Honeycomb (and HTC is on record saying <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/HTC-Says-Honeycomb-for-Flyer-Arrives-Soon-196807.shtml">it will eventually</a>), I'm so happy with the built-in software that I don't mind.  There are some tablet-friendly versions of applications that only run in Honeycomb and I would like to run those, but it's not a big loss for my usage pattern of the device.</p>
<h1>The Pen</h1>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the big selling point of the Flyer is the electronic pen.  There is a special hardware button next to the regular buttons that allows you to specify pen options such as style (pencil, pen, paintbrush, highlighter, eraser), size, and color.  You also don't have to use any of that, <strong>the instant you touch the pen to the screen it recognizes it and lets you draw</strong>.</p>
<p>There are two hardware buttons on the pen, highlighter and eraser.  Pressing and holding either button puts the pen into that mode while you write.  Support for both in applications is spotty at best, and often the highlighter doesn't do what I'd wish (let me highlight text easily).  In the Notes application, however, all pen functions work perfectly.</p>
<p>The pen is a bit thicker than I'd really like, I think to accomodate the AAA batteries it requires.  There's also no place on the Flyer itself to store or attach the pen, which makes it somewhat easy to lose.</p>
<p>The pen's performance is good - there is not much in the way of lag between making a motion with the pen and the appropriate line showing up in the app.  That said, handwriting with the pen is probably a no-go unless you write somewhat slowly.  I write incredibly fast and it cannot register much of what I write.</p>
<h1>How I Use It</h1>
<p>So why did I want an electronic version of a notepad for school, when a regular notepad would have been fine?  Simple: <strong>to solve my typing/drawing dilemma</strong>.</p>
<p>See, I've been typing since I was very young.  All my life I would ask teachers if I could type assignments rather than hand-write them.  My handwriting muscles never really developed as much as they probably should have, so my writing something by hand is usually extremely slow for me.  If I try to write quickly, it's completely illegible later on, even to me.  I simply cannot write with a pen as quickly as I can think.  As a programmer, however, I've finely honed my typing skills, and I can easily type at pace with my brain.</p>
<p>The end result of this is that taking notes on paper doesn't work for me.  When I take notes, I flip open a laptop and type into a text editor.  This works fine for conferences and the other rare occasion when I have to take notes, but it falls flat when I need to actually draw a figure or graph.  I can't draw with a mouse (or a laptop touchpad) with any reasonable speed, and I've resorted to drawing figures with ASCII in the past (which is painfully slow).</p>
<p>So when it comes to school, I can either take notes on my computer, which means no drawings, or I can take notes in a notebook, which means no words.  <strong>The HTC Flyer solves my typing/drawing dilemma, allowing me to easily type notes as well as draw figures when needed</strong>.  Typed notes and drawings are stored together, in a single note, which is uploaded automatically to my Evernote account.  It is, quite literally, the perfect solution to my problem (tablet laptops cost quite a bit more money and run shitty software, generally).</p>
<p>I purchased the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/tablet-accessories/for-android/devices/8232">Logitech Tablet Keyboard</a>, which claims to be for Android 3.0 but works fine with the Flyer's version of Android.  This keyboard is a full-size keyboard, meaning I don't have to cram my fingers together to take notes, and it is transported in a handy case that opens up into a stand for the tablet itself.  Typing on the keyboard is a breeze, and I type at exactly the same speed as on a regular computer.  The "Home" key doesn't work for some reason, but nearly every other key works great (including the volume controls).  <strong>The keyboard makes my Flyer completely awesome</strong>.</p>
<p>It looks a little dorky, but the Tablet + Keyboard + Keyboard Case Stand + Pen is an absolutely <strong>phenomenal setup for notetaking in class</strong>.  It's easy to switch from typing to drawing and back again.  It's also easy to pick the tablet up and take a quick picture, for times when the material in a class or a presentation cannot be transcribed into notes quickly.  </p>
<p>As an added bonus, there's a "record" feature which automatically records audio and ties it to the same note.  I can go in, set up my device, press record, and at the end of the lecture I have a complete audio version of the lecture, complete with my own typewritten notes, drawings, attached lecture notes, and photographs from class.  All of this is instantly synched with my Evernote account (premium is not required, but I recommend it).  <b>This is a tech-savvy student's dream device, I couldn't ask for much more.</b></p>
<h1>Gripes</h1>
<p>It's not perfect, however.  The tablet isn't terribly usable for notetaking in horizontal mode, as the notes are a fixed width and so they get substantially zoomed-in in that mode, making the font very large and severely limiting space for notetaking.  This is a minor gripe.  More importantly, however, the audio on the device is <b>TERRIBLE</b>.  I think the microphone must face the user of the device or something, because every audio recording of a lecture I've made has been absolutely worthless after the fact.  The audio is muffled and incomprehensible.  I even sat directly in front of the presenter for one class, and it was still useless.  I think I might investigate getting a bluetooth microphone to see if that helps, but I haven't done that yet.</p>
<p>I also with the pen could be clipped onto or stored inside the tablet.  A carrying case with an external pouch is an absolute must, I wound up getting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CJ8DKE">this one</a>.</p>
<p>The PDF reader is crap.  I wanted to store my textbooks on the device digitally in case I wanted to consult one while on campus, but the PDF reader has no bookmarking feature and does not remember where you last were, nor does it allow skipping to specific page numbers or chapters.  <strong>My textbook is 1,200 pages long, scrolling past 800 pages one at a time to get to the part I need is impossible</strong>.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of stupid bloatware HTC insists on installing on the device, such as OnLive, PressReader, Locations, and other apps I have no use for as someone using the Flyer as a notebook.  These programs cannot be uninstalled, which is a shame.  One included app is for WiFi Printing, which is a great idea, but unfortunately my printer (and most others) are not supported.</p>
<p>Another annoying thing is that the default on-screen keyboard does not dismiss itself in the presence of a hardware keyboard.  So if I tap in a note to begin typing, it pops up the on screen keyboard even though I have a hardware keyboard attached via bluetooth, cutting my screen real estate in half.  Luckily, the tablet runs Android, which means I can solve nearly any software problem, and indeed I did by installing <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard">AnySoftKeyboard</a>, which dismisses itself automatically when I press a key on the hardware keyboard.</p>
<p>I also found it annoying that, when the screen times out, turning it back on forces you to do the "slide to unlock" routine.  If I'm in the middle of taking notes, I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard, let alone fiddle with dragging a ring to part of the screen to unlock my device.  Once again, Android to the rescue, I installed <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/screen-mode-widget-lite/com.ooha.screenmodelite">Screen Mode Widget Lite</a>, which allowed me to turn off the locking, and even turn off the screen timeout entirely from a convenient widget on my home screen.</p>
<h1>Overall</h1>
<p><strong>All in all, I absolutely love my HTC Flyer</strong>.  I have a small number of minor gripes with it, but I can get past all of them pretty easily.  I have never seen any device in the world that does as good a job as the Flyer of enabling someone like me to take notes in class.  I love the audio recording, camera, attachments, keyboard, and pen combination, and the fact that it automatically uploads to my Evernote account (and is indexed, so I can search) is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Before I saw the Flyer, I was worried about how I was going to take good notes in school, but HTC released what is quite literally the perfect device for a student like me, just in time for me to start school.  I almost feel like I want to find the engineers responsible for thinking this device up and personally thank them for making school so much more manageable for me.  <b>If you're reading this, thank you HTC</b>.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the Flyer is that it's so unique and interesting that other students or even lecturers have a tendency to start asking about it and wanting to see it demoed.  When your biggest problem is that your new toy is so cool that everyone wants to play with it, I suppose you don't really have a problem.</p>
