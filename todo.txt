better index.html page.  some kind of intro or something, maybe?  seems like it shouldn't list "all" going back forever, maybe that page should be paginated?  JS pagination?
individual tag pages, its easy and better than the js solution.  and jquery can go to bottom then
the image borders arent the same in chrome and firefox... ie is probably h0rked
