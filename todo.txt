more responsive css
[css] maybe the sidebar and header should scroll with the page?
better index.html page.  some kind of intro or something, maybe?  seems like it shouldn't list "all" going back forever, maybe that page should be paginated?  JS pagination?
should a plugin just generate the toc? is that even possible?
