				<p>To catch people up on some blogosphere drama:</p><p>Last month, Heather Arthur posted on her blog about an unfortunate incident in which some people on Twitter had found some <a href="https://github.com/harthur/replace">code she wrote in GitHub</a>, and <a href="http://harthur.wordpress.com/2013/01/24/771/">people started trashing her on Twitter for it</a>.  Some of those people are considered leaders in the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">Software Craftsmanship</a> movement, in particular <a href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a>.  Corey immediately <a href="http://programmingtour.blogspot.com/2013/01/im-sorry.html">apologized</a> for acting like an asshole, and I think his apology was sincere because I&#39;ve met Corey and frankly the guy is almost annoyingly nice (he went around RubyConf 2012 taking a picture with every damn person there).  But Ted Neward saw this turn of events and concluded that Corey&#39;s actions were not orthogonal to his involvement in Software Craftsmanship, but actually influenced by them, and he <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2013/01/24/On+The+Dark+Side+Of+Craftsmanship.aspx">posted as such on his blog</a>.</p><p>Neward&#39;s basic point is that this is the exact kind of behavior we should expect as a side effect of the Software Craftsmanship movement.  By it&#39;s nature, it attempts to create a segregation between those who are &quot;in the know&quot; and those who are not, and he felt the behavior of Corey and others was a byproduct of this segregation.  They saw Heather as an &quot;other&quot; and were overly harsh in their criticisms, emboldened in so doing by their sense of Craftsmanship.  Neward took a lot of shit for this view on Twitter, with most people arguing that this was done by Software Craftsmen, but it wasn&#39;t done <strong>because</strong> they were Software Craftsmen, and it makes no sense to criticize the entire movement based on the action of a few members, regardless of how high their profile is.  Neward responded to all of this feedback in <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2013/01/26/More+On+Craftsmanship.aspx">a second blog post</a>, where he reinforces his original point.</p><p>Uncle Bob Martin, one of the first five signers of the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto and author of Clean Code and The Clean Coder, then responded to all of this drama with <a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2013/01/30/The-Craftsman-And-The-Laborer.html">his own post</a>.  Bob takes particular issue with Neward&#39;s promotion of what he sees as the opposite of a Software Craftsman, a Software Laborer.  In Neward&#39;s words, a Laborer is someone &quot;who cranked out one crappy app after another in (what else?) Visual Basic [...] their apps were sloppy, bloated, and ugly...cut-and-paste cobbled-together duct-tape wonders.&quot;  At the end of the post, Neward bows &quot;with respect to the &quot;software laborers&quot; of the world, who churn out quality code without concern for &quot;craftsmanship&quot;, because their lives are more than just their code.&quot;</p>

				<p>My third semester in the PhD program is over, and it has unquestionably been my hardest yet.  I bit off way more than I could chew, this semester was extremely unpleasant and, for the first time since going back to school, I was glad for the semester to end.</p><p>I took two 7000-level PhD courses at once (previously I had only done one in a semester) which was part of the problem.  Originally I was planning on doing three, but quickly decided that was insane and dropped one of the classes, which I&#39;ll now be taking in the Spring.  One of these two remaining classes was material I had never been exposed to at all, and it also happened to be structured in a way that would have made it exceptionally difficult even if I had, while the other was material to which I had minimal exposure.  I also took two courses on Coursera during this period of time, both of which I took quite seriously, as though they were credit courses.  And if all of that wasn&#39;t crazy enough, I managed to once again get roped into grading.</p><p>Textbook: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Pb-E-Rich/dp/0071008942/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355376492&amp;sr=8-1">Artificial Intelligence, 2nd ed.</a></p><p>I had never taken an A.I. class as an undergrad, and I always regretted it.  I felt like I should at least be see what it&#39;s about, and I was always really interested in things like evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, and other metaheuristics.  This class was taught by a professor I hadn&#39;t yet had, so this was a real gamble for me.</p>

				<p>This Fall, I took a course on Computational Complexity.  I&#39;ve been exposed to complexity in Computer Science before, but as an undergrad it rarely went beyond discussing P, NP, and NP-Complete.  While I enjoyed the class a great deal, I was slightly disappointed that we mostly studied some of the space complexity classes like PSPACE as well as went much, much deeper in depth on P, NP, and NP-Complete, without covering many of the other complexity classes, of which there are lots.</p><p>For a final paper, we had to pick a topic of our own choosing in Complexity Theory and research it on our own.  For my topic, I choose to explore a bunch of the other important classes in complexity theory.  I had never had any exposure to any of these classes before, so I really enjoyed this project, though I was unable to cover as many classes as I&#39;d have liked, and none of them in as much depth as I was hoping.</p><p>Nonetheless, I&#39;m pretty happy with my paper, which provides an undergraduate-level explanation of 26 other complexity classes, based off <a href="http://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">The Complexity Zoo</a>, kept by MIT professor Scott Aaronson.  I tried to boil these classes down to the bare essentials and explain them with examples in plain english as much as I could.  The goal of the paper is to expose those new to Complexity Theory or early in their Computer Science careers to a handful of interesting classes and explain how they relate to each other, the more common classes, and of course the $$P =? NP$$ question.</p><p>You can download the paper <strong><a href="/files/complexity_zoo.pdf">here</a></strong>.</p>

				<p>In December, I posted about <a href="/2011/12/15/scala-first-impressions/">my early thoughts</a> on Scala after using it for a short time.  Initially, I thought that using Scala didn&#39;t buy very much - the functional style could be adopted in in Java, and the syntax and libraries could be ugly.</p><p>Since that time, I&#39;ve been using Scala almost exclusively, and I wish to revise my view: <strong>Scala is awesome</strong>.</p><p>While some of my initial thoughts still stand, particularly that Scala APIs often overuse operator overloading, much of my perception has shifted otherwise.  Scala not only allows, but encourages solid functional programming principles that are difficult or impossible in Java.</p><p>A great deal of my perception shift has been due to familiarity and training.  I realize that a lot of my earlier issues with Scala were due to my own lack of comfort with the language, and over the last year I&#39;ve done a great deal to level up my Scala skills significantly, like:</p>

				<p>I recently read a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Career-Programmer-Guerilla-Imperfect/dp/1590596242">The Career Programmer</a> by <a href="http://christopherduncan.com/">Christopher Duncan</a>.  I typically don&#39;t post book reviews unless I really love a book and want to spread the word, but in this case I felt compelled to post in order to spread the warning.  I can&#39;t remember a book I&#39;ve hated more.</p><p>&quot;The Career Programmer&quot; is meant to be a dispensation of wisdom from a sage, a book that gives younger programmers keen insights from someone who has been in the industry for a long, long time.  I tend to really enjoy books like this, so I picked up a copy.  Unfortunately, it comes across as an anachronism, like the book time-traveled out of the mid-90&#39;s. While reading it, I felt compelled to double-check the publication year, and was absolutely astonished that it was printed in 2006. The &quot;wisdom&quot; of the book is so hopelessly out of date with the current state of software development that I cannot recommend it to absolutely anyone.</p><p>Duncan&#39;s view of software development is straight out of Dilbert. Managers are idiots that hold all the power, programmers are just lackeys that do what they are told. In his world, &quot;shit rolls downhill&quot; and programmers are at the bottom of the hill. Duncan has over a decade of experience in the industry, which is the basis for his advice. Well, I also have a decade of experience and I have never, ever worked in a place as dysfunctional as what he describes as typical. Perhaps I am extremely lucky or just extremely talented, but I doubt either of those are true.  If I found myself at a company like those Duncan describes, I&#39;d leave immediately and get a new job, I certainly wouldn&#39;t build a 10-year career stringing those experiences together.</p><p>As an example of what I&#39;m talking about, Duncan describes that programmers are expected to &quot;do whatever it takes&quot; to get the job done, which means:</p>

				<p>There are a lot of things that annoy me in my industry: lack of commitment to writing quality code, no discipline regarding tests, and many, many more.  These things irritate me, and I see them all the time, but there is one irritation I encounter that is so common that it dwarfs all others, at least in frequency.</p><p>How common is it?  It&#39;s so common that this post has been in my Drafts for about five years.  What I mean is, I wrote it in reaction to someone irritating me at work, but decided not to post it because I was worried they would see it and know I was talking about them.  And it&#39;s been in Drafts since that day because I encounter it so often that any day I post it, it will be seen as a response to something that actually happened at work.  <strong>There hasn&#39;t been a break in the last five years where I could post it without at least one person thinking it was a reference to them.</strong>  That&#39;s how common it is.</p><p>In fact, I know posting even now, it&#39;s going to look like it&#39;s related to an occurrence this week.  STFU co-workers, I wrote this shit ages ago.</p><p>Anyway, what I&#39;m talking about is developers refusing to do things or complaining about doing things because they distract them from what they call &quot;Real Work.&quot;</p>

				<p>Whenever people start talking about NP-Complete problems, or even NP problems, one of the first examples they reach for is the classic Traveling Salesperson Problem.  TSP makes sense because it intuitively can&#39;t be solved quickly due to how difficult the problem sounds, so it&#39;s reasonable for people to use it in discussions about P versus NP.</p><p>The problem is, 99% of the time people discuss Traveling Salesperson being NP-Complete, <strong>they are wrong.</strong>  The Traveling Salesperson Problem, as it is usually described, isn&#39;t NP-Complete at all.  In fact, it&#39;s not even in NP.</p><p>The Traveling Salesperson Problem is typically described as &quot;given a graph of cities various distances away from each other, find the shortest path for a salesperson to visit every city exactly once and return to the origin city.&quot;</p><p>More formally, TSP is &quot;Given a graph $$G$$ of vertices $$V$$ connected via nonzero cost edges $$E$$, find the lowest-cost Hamiltonian circuit&quot;</p>

Over time, I have discovered that I have a particular way of working that I prefer above all others, and I would like to describe it.</p><p>Imagine you are writing some software that will have a number of interacting components.  I&#39;m going to suggest a toy example, one that will help illustrate what I&#39;m talking about, but is not so complex to actually warrant it.  Imagine you are going to write a Lottery game.  Players will have lottery tickets, and they will listen for Callers to read out the winning lottery number (think Observer pattern).  The Callers will use a Hopper with numbered balls, selecting the appropriate number of balls and then calling out the winning number at the end.</p><p>To follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle">Single-Responsibility Principle</a>, you think your game will probably have three classes:</p><p>The <code>Player</code> is going to interact with the <code>Caller</code>, and the <code>Caller</code> is going to interact with the Hopper.</p>

I have a bunch of requirements that have made this quite difficult:</p><p>I tried using <a href="http://tiddlywiki.org/">TiddlyWiki</a> with DropBox as the cloud-based sync mechanism, but I use Google Chrome as my browser, which has a lot of trouble with the Java plugin that does the saving.

Gollum is a Ruby-based wiki server that runs completely self-contained (you don&#39;t need to install PHP or a database) and is backed by Git.

				<p>The second semester in my PhD program had me crank up the difficulty level a bit.

PhD students need to take 6 Master&#39;s classes and 4 PhD classes (plus 30 credit hours of research), and ideally 3 of those 6 Master&#39;s classes will be transferred for me.
