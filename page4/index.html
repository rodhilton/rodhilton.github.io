				<p>Paul Dyson has made a blog post entitled &quot;<a href="http://pauldyson.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/technical-debt-and-the-lean-startup/">Technical Debt and the Lean Startup</a>&quot; as well as commented on my post about <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/07/22/when-to-work-on-technical-debt/">When To Work On Technical Debt</a>, challenging some of my claims.  I read through his post and, while it makes a number of good points, I think it ultimately advocates for a risky manner of running a business.  I started typing this as a response to his comment, but realized that it was long enough to warrant a separate post, so I&#39;d like to go through his post&#39;s points one by one.</p><p>Let&#39;s look at his first example: that it&#39;s okay in a lean start-up to have an area of the system only understood by a single person.  He basically argues that, in a small start-up, you don&#39;t have enough people to pair-program on everything, so having a single person understand the system is alright.  This is a false dichotomy, he is saying that code must be either <em>paired</em> or it must be <em>understood by only one person.</em>  Even if you do not have the resources to pair-program every task, you can still have collective code ownership by simply having regular code reviews with your team.  It&#39;s not quite as good as pairing, but it&#39;s leaps and bounds better than a single person knowing the system.</p><p>Having an area of the system understood by only one person is unbelievably risky, so much so that I&#39;m a bit stunned that someone as experienced as Paul would advocate it publicly.  If that one person fell ill, or took an offer at another company, he would have been royally screwed.  Development would have to completely stop while the other members of his team came up to speed on that aspect of the system, unable to ask questions of the original developer.  This situation would be even worse if he had very few developers; he may have to wait and continue development only after hiring a replacement.</p><p>What he&#39;s basically saying is &quot;look, I know people say you need to drive with glasses if you have poor eyesight, but I have poor eyesight and I&#39;ve been driving for years without getting in an accident.  If you have poor eyesight, you should consider driving without glasses too.&quot;</p>

				<p>I recently wanted to set up Jenkins on my personal workstation to manage builds for side and personal projects.  I was already running Tomcat on the system since I use that to run Subsonic, so I wanted to install Jenkins in the same container.</p><p>The process of getting everything working was just short of a nightmare, but I managed to eventually get my Jenkins inside of Tomcat successfully checking out and building projects through Git.  While I was dealing with various errors, I was doing a lot of Googling.  My searches seemed to indicate that very few people were trying to set things up as I was, because the internet was very little help.  When hours of Googling turns up nothing, you know you either have a) a technical problem that nobody else has tried to solve or b) a weird fetish.</p><p>So I&#39;ve written this post to explain how to set things up.  But rather than a simple tutorial, I&#39;ve written it as a step-by-step account of the various difficulties I had setting it up.  I&#39;ve done this partially to draw a little bit of attention to a gap in the error messaging of these tools, but mostly so that the next person who Googles for specific error messages may come across this page and avoid some headaches.</p><p>Ultimately, what I wanted was Jenkins installed in Tomcat running as a system service in Ubuntu to be able to check out projects via Git repositories via the SSH protocol.  I will assume you already have Git installed because it is awesome, but if not it&#39;s as easy as using your package manager.</p>

				<p>I hear the same complaints and concerns from all sorts of different software development organizations.  It seems that development teams only suffer from a small handful of problems in the broad sense, and nearly every team seems to share them.</p><p>One problem I encounter constantly is this: <strong>&quot;We don&#39;t have time to address our technical debt!&quot;</strong></p><p>Every company I&#39;ve ever worked for has had this problem to some degree.  The development team realizes that there are some parts of the system that need to be cleaned up, but for a wide variety of different reasons, they feel like they don&#39;t have the time to actually work on improving those areas of the system.</p><p>The truth is, this is not actually that difficult a problem to deal solve.  As software developers, we deal with significantly more complex problems on a regular basis.</p>

				<p>Today was my last day at <a href="http://www.rallydev.com">Rally Software</a>.  In two weeks, I will be starting a new job, working on a variety of web services, mostly with Java and Groovy.</p><p>Leaving Rally was tough for me.  It&#39;s easy to leave a job when I&#39;m unhappy, or irritated with management, or tired of a project, or if I&#39;m just not learning anything new.  But none of these were the case with Rally.  I&#39;m leaving not because anything is wrong with Rally, but because there&#39;s simply a better opportunity for me elsewhere.  Time Warner is in downtown Denver (right near campus), they have a great benefits and tuition reimbursement program, they&#39;re working with technology I want to know more about, and their staff reads like a fantasy league of my career (I already know half the developers from other jobs).  The switch just made sense for me, but it wasn&#39;t easy to leave.</p><p>When I started at Rally nearly 3 years ago, it was a company that was struggling.  Not financially, but technologically.  For a long time, the company had done very well spreading agile to various customers, led by a product that was having features added to it at a breakneck pace.  <strong>From the outside, the company seemed to have things together, but internally the codebase was a monument of technical debt and hasty decisions.</strong></p><p>The company had survived in &quot;startup mode&quot; for years, but the team was starting to buckle under the pressure of technical debt.  Feature development was slowing, and external bug reports were flooding in. Things weren&#39;t looking good.</p>

				<p>Everyone who&#39;s been programming professionally for a while knows the standard format of the technical interview.  You go in, there&#39;s a whiteboard in the room, and you write code on it to answer questions.</p><p>Everyone also has the same basic complaints about these interviews.  In a normal work environment, you have access to an API or search engine, but at a whiteboard you don&#39;t.  Whiteboard questions generally don&#39;t include much in the way of overall design, and they&#39;re typically limited to simple algorithms, so they don&#39;t really test all of a candidate&#39;s skills.  And let&#39;s be honest, programmers tend to have awful handwriting, and writing vertically on a large board doesn&#39;t help things.</p><p><strong>We like coding.</strong>  We like sitting at a computer.  We like running ideas by our coworkers and our compilers.  The whiteboard interview helps interviewers know a bit about candidates, but it doesn&#39;t help candidates learn anything about interviewers.  In short, the standard interview leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>At my current company, we&#39;ve tried to improve the technical interview by augmenting it with something else: <strong>a pairing exercise</strong>.</p>

				<p>The Wordpress <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyphenator/">Hyphenator</a> plugin is a great plugin that uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/">Hyphenator.js</a> to perform client-side hyphenation of blog posts.  I think this makes full-justified posts look much nicer, and I use it extensively on this site.</p><p>Hyphenator.js relies on being told what classnames to look for in a page to know what can be hyphenated, but it also has an option called <code>donthyphenateclassname</code> which allows one to specify classnames that never get hyphenated, even when they are inside of a class that ought to be.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Hyphenator Wordpress plugin does not support this option.  I needed support for it, so I added it.  I don&#39;t really know of a place to submit this patch, so I&#39;m posting it here.

				<p>There&#39;s a great WordPress plugin called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/latex/">Latex for Wordpress</a>.  It&#39;s less popular than the similar <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-latex/">WP Latex</a>, but I think it&#39;s better.</p><p>Both plugins allow Wordpress users to insert $$\LaTeX$$ into their posts, but the main reason why the former is superior is that, while both plugins generate image files containing processed text, Latex for Wordpress augments this functionality with <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a client-side JavaScript $$\LaTeX$$ renderer.  MathJax is the primary means of rendering, with png files as a fallback.  This means that $$\LaTeX$$ renders much more cleanly.</p><p>Unfortunately, Latex for Wordpress does not provide an option to provide custom config options to MathJax.  This is a problem, since my blog uses a large font for text, and the default text scaling size is very small.  I needed a way to use the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/options/HTML-CSS.html">MathJax config</a> to adjust the text scale.</p><p>I went ahead and patched this functionality into Latex for Wordpress.  So far, I have been unable to figure out how to commit this patch to the maintainer of the project, so until I am able to do that I&#39;m posting it here.</p>

				<p>Within the broad spectrum of human feeling, there lies an emotion very much unlike its biochemical brethren: the sense of regret. What separates regret from other emotions is not its potency, but its resilience. Joy, misery, love, and even grief can dull or dissipate given enough time, but regret endures, gnawing at the back of one’s mind, reminding each of us of what could have been, but is not. Regret never wanes and it never dissolves; <strong>regret festers</strong>. </p><p>Like so many others, I have accumulated a number of regrets over my life.  Though I’ve learned to live with many of these, one regret in particular has lingered in my mind for the past six years: I regret the limitations I placed on myself as an undergraduate at the University of Rochester.</p><p>Since I was a child, I’ve known that what I wanted to do with my life was write computer programs.  From the moment of my first experience writing code on the glowing box attached to a 286 in my father’s study, I’ve been driven by a vivid, clear goal of writing software professionally.  Since the age of 6, whenever someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I gave the same answer.  When I told my high school guidance counselor, he told me that I needed to go to school and major in Computer Science, so that’s what I did.</p><p>What I found as early as my first year at school was that my selected major included a variety of subjects that I was not expecting.  I was exposed to material that seemed wholly unrelated to writing programs professionally.  Algorithmic complexity?  Turing machines?  Chomsky Normal Form?  It all seemed too theoretical, too far removed from the actual process of programming.  I needed to prepare myself for my career, and I felt I had no time for theory.  I decided to spend the next four years avoiding the theoretical material as much as possible.  Instead, I focused on my systems classes, which I found both engrossing and practical.  <strong>I even recall how proud I was for passing a particular theory class without more than a cursory glance at the textbook</strong>.</p>
