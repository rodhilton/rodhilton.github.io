				<p>It&#39;s been a long time since I posted about how school is going, and I figured the folks who read my blog (all two of you, hi Mom!) might be curious.</p><p>Since the end of my Spring 2013 semester, I&#39;ve been in &quot;Research Phase&quot;.  This means I&#39;m finished with classwork and have been working on my research project.  It&#39;s been a little over two years now, so here&#39;s what has happened.</p><p>About two years ago, I started working with my advisor trying to figure out what area my research would be in.  I&#39;ve always had a fascination with Genetic Algorithms and Metaheuristics, so I knew I wanted to do something involving that subfield.  Two of my projects at school utilized Genetic Algorithms, and I had a lot of experience in the area.</p><p>I went back to school to primarily focus on CS Theory &amp; Algorithms, but I knew my biggest strength was Software Engineering.  In other words, I like theory, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a real theoretician, and I wanted to play to my strengths a bit.  This meant I wanted to be writing real, working code, rather than proofs.  If I wound up proving anything interesting, that&#39;d be great, but I didn&#39;t want that to be part of my critical path to completing my PhD.  Lots of CS PhD&#39;s go off with a white board and paper and output some amazing results, but I knew that wasn&#39;t going to be me.</p>

				<p>I work with Grails a lot and while I really enjoy it for the most part, there are definitely some weird quirks of the framework.</p><p>One such quirk is something I encounter whenever I want to write unit tests against grails controller methods that render out templates directly.  This isn&#39;t something I do very often - generally I prefer rendering out JSON and parsing it with client-JS - but in some cases when there&#39;s a lot of markup for a page element that you want to be updateable via ajax, it makes sense to render out a template like <code>render(template: &#39;somePartial&#39;)</code> directly from a controller method.</p><p>Unfortunately, these kinds of methods are very difficult to write tests against.  While a normal render exposes a <code>model</code> and <code>view</code> variable that you can test against, for some reason using a render with a template doesn&#39;t seem to do this.</p><p>I&#39;ve seen lots of solutions where you stuff a fake string matching the name of the template using some metaclass wizardry, but then you&#39;re stuck dealing with some semi-view stuff in what you might want to simply be a unit test about the model values placed by the controller method.</p>

				<p>My default yearly conference, for many years, has been <a href="http://uberconf.com/conference/denver/2015/07/home">UberConf</a>.  I really enjoy UberConf because it&#39;s packed full of lots of great sessions, and it&#39;s conveniently local.  However, because I go to various local user groups and attend so often, I find that, if I go two years in a row there are too many sessions I&#39;ve seen before, and I wind up disappointed.  So for the past few years, I&#39;ve been alternating between UberConf and something new.  Two years ago, it was <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2013/07/30/oscon-2013-a-review/">OSCON</a>, and this year it was <a href="https://qconnewyork.com/">QCon New York</a>.</p>

<p>I chose QCon for a few reasons.  One, the sessions seemed very focused on architecture and higher-level concepts, with very few language/technology talks.  This was right up my alley because, while there are some languages and tools I&#39;d like to go deeper on, I think a more significant area for improvement for me is architecture and scalability.  We get tons of traffic at my job - more than any other place I&#39;ve ever worked - so I&#39;ve had to learn a lot about scalability, and the nature of the work has forced me to really see broad system design differently.</p>

<p>I went to QCon specifically wanting to improve some areas where I was weak, namely containerization, microservices, and reactive programming.  I hear a lot of buzz about these things, and they pop up on recent <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/a-z">ThoughtWorks Technology Radar</a>s, and QCon seemed to have a lot of sessions to offer in these areas.  It took a LOT of convincing to get my employer to agree to send me to a conference location as expensive as New York, but eventually they approved it.  Here I will detail some of my thoughts about the experience, in case it may be of use to others considering QCon.</p>

				<p>This blog was never intended to be popular by any stretch of the imagination.  Largely I started it simply to have a place to gather solutions to technical problems I&#39;ve encountered, so that I could easily look those solutions up if I needed them again.  The blog has always run on my own shared hosting server, on a self-installed version of Wordpress.</p>

<p>To my great surprise, a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2986e4/the_worst_programming_interview_question/">few</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/hn1fx/a_different_kind_of_technical_interview/">of</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/yvr9/my_interview_with_google/">my</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/q98ld/the_star_wars_saga_suggested_viewing_order_iv_v/">posts</a> have found their way to the front page of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/domain/nomachetejuggling.com">reddit</a>.  My <a href="/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">post about Star Wars</a> has been mentioned on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=effD1u4oCRE">King of the Nerds</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keSFjjhUyVA">The Big Bang Theory</a>, and even landed me an <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/20/291977042/theres-more-than-one-way-to-watch-star-wars">Interview on NPR</a>.  </p>

<table class='image aligncenter'><tr><td><script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=Machete+Order&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=600&h=330"></script></td></tr></table>

<p>Needless to say, the traffic to my blog has been both extremely unexpected and unpredictable.  The Star Wars post had been online for months with virtually no traffic before <a href="http://archive.wired.com/geekdad/2012/02/machete-order-star-wars/">Wired</a> suddenly linked to it, instantly decimating my web server.  I&#39;ve fought and fought with various configurations for Wordpress, used <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">as much caching</a> as possible, and even had my <a href="https://www.servint.net/">web host</a> temporarily upgrade my service, all trying to keep a web site that makes no money online even when traffic increases by a factor of 100 overnight.  <strong>When my site goes down, it&#39;s embarrassing, because even though it&#39;s just a personal blog on a shared host, it gives the impression that I, as a software developer, don&#39;t know how to make a web site scale</strong>.</p>

<h1>Switching to Jekyll</h1>

<table class='image alignright' width='306'><tr><td><img src='/assets/jekyll-logo.png' width='300' height='141'/></td></tr></table>

<p>So after the most recent pummeling I took due to a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7953725">Hacker News link</a>, I decided it was time to <strong>bite the bullet and convert the entire site to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></strong>.  I&#39;ve messed around with the technology before to build another, smaller, blog, so I was somewhat familiar with the constructs and idioms.  A lot of work and ten custom plugins later, the entire site was converted, with very little loss of functionality.</p>

				<p>Years ago, I wrote about a <a href="/2008/12/11/my-least-favorite-interview-question/">particular type of interview question</a> that I despise.  Today I&#39;d like to discuss a much more specific question, rather than a type.  I&#39;ve never been asked this question myself, but I have seen it asked in an actual interview, and I officially nominate it as the worst question I&#39;ve ever heard in an interview.</p>

<p>A co-worker at a previous company used to ask this question, and it was the first time I&#39;d ever heard it in an interview setting.  This company did pair interviews, two engineers with one candidate.  One day he and I were the two engineers interviewing some poor candidate.  The candidate had actually done pretty well as far as I was concerned, and then my co-worker busted this question out.  The candidate stumbled over the answer, visibly frustrated with himself.  In the post-interview pow-wow, all of the engineers who&#39;d interviewed him gave him the thumbs up, except my interview partner, who refused to hire him on the grounds that he completely flubbed this question, and &quot;any engineer worth his salt should be able to answer it.&quot;  He actually said that if we hired this individual, he would be unwilling to work on a team with the candidate.  For what it&#39;s worth, the story has a happy ending, in that we hired the candidate in spite of his protests, fired the co-worker within a few months, and the candidate is still at that company, doing quite well.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this question perfectly represents everything that can go wrong with an interview question, so I&#39;d like to discuss it here to explain why it&#39;s almost hilariously awful as an interview question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Write a function that can detect a cycle in a linked list.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seems like your basic algorithm coding question at first, right?  Hop up and write the function on the white board; totally reasonable, right?  Except it&#39;s not, it&#39;s brain-meltingly terrible.  Let&#39;s break it down.</p>

				<p>When I graduated with a Computer Science degree ten years ago, I was excited to dive into the world of professional programming.  I had done well in school, and I thought I was completely ready to be employed doing my dream job: writing code.  What I discovered in my very first interview, however, was that I was massively underprepared to be an actual professional programmer.  I knew all about data structures and algorithms, but nothing about how actual professional, &quot;enterprise&quot; software was written.  I was lucky to find a job at a place willing to take a chance on me, and proceeded to learn as much as I could as quickly as I could to make up for my deficiencies.  This involved reading a LOT of books.</p><p>Here I reflect on my 10-year experience programming professionally and all of the books I&#39;ve read in that time, and offer up the ten that had the most profound impact on my career.  Note that these are not the &quot;10 best&quot; programming books.  I do feel all of these books are very good, but that&#39;s not the only reason I&#39;m selecting them here; I&#39;m mentioning them because I felt that I was a profoundly different person after reading each than I was beforehand.  Each of these books forced me to think differently about my profession, and I believe they helped mold me into the programmer I am today.</p><p>None of these books are language books.  I may feel like learning to program in, say, Scala, had a profound impact on how I work professionally, but the enlightening thing was Scala itself, not the book I used to help me learn it.  Similarly, I&#39;d say that learning to use Git had a significant impact on how I view version control, but it was Git that had the impact on me, not the book that I used to teach myself the tool.  The books on this list are about the the content they dumped into my brain, not just a particular technology they taught me, even if a technology had a profound impact on me.</p><p>So, without further ado...</p>

				<p><em>TL;DR: After a decade of service, CenturyLink decided I wasn&#39;t worth keeping as a customer, so I switched to Comcast Business Internet.  Even if CenturyLink tells you that you have no data caps, you do.</em></p><p>When I first moved to Colorado nearly a decade ago, I signed up for Comcast&#39;s Residential high-speed internet service, and I hated it.  I had to reset my cable modem once every week because it would stop working properly, and my internet noticeably slowed down when people would get home from school/work in my apartment complex.</p><p>I did some research and determined that, for the kinds of internet speeds being offered at the time (around 1-5Mbps down), Qwest&#39;s DSL had similar prices to Comcast.  Additionally, because it was DSL, I could use my own Netgear router that had a DSL modem built in, and I wouldn&#39;t have to mess with company equipment.  Also, DSL&#39;s speed varies based on your distance to a hub, not based on how many people are currently using it.  I thought I could avoid both of my major problems by switching to DSL for about the same price, so I did, paying for the maximum possible speed at the time, 5Mbps.</p><p>For many years, Qwest was the only monthly bill I never had any trouble with.  Sometimes my cable would go out or look pixelated, sometimes my heating bill would be surprisingly massive, I was always having annoying issues with my cell phone service, but month after month, I never even noticed I had Qwest.  It was just there, it worked, it never went down, it never slowed down.  It was great.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve finally written my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Absolutely%20No%20Machete%20Juggling&amp;hl=en">first real Android app</a>.  I dabbled a bit with Android development in the very early days, writing <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rallydroid/">an app that interacted with the web services</a> of the company I was working for at the time.  This app was ugly, written for Froyo, and frankly barely worked at all.  It was a 20% time project at my then-employer, but I never went back and worked on it after the initial effort, and never even bothered getting it packaged into the Android Market, largely out of embarrassment.</p><p>I&#39;ve been wanting to get into Android development more seriously since that effort, because I overall liked the idea, and as a big Android user myself, I felt that it was essential <em>I be able to develop applications for my own device</em>, as being unable to do so was a lot like using Linux without the ability to write shell scripts.</p><p>I&#39;ve taken two all-day training sessions on Android before as part of larger development conferences, and while I was able to suss out some basics about the lifecycle and other Android fundamentals from them, neither left me with any sense of real understanding of how I could develop something for Android that people might actually use.  But at <a href="/2013/07/30/oscon-2013-a-review/">OSCON 2013</a>, I took an excellent half-day Android class taught by <a href="https://twitter.com/markog">Marko Garenta</a>.  Among other things, he showed me, for the first time, how to write a modern-looking Holo app, how to use asynchronous background tasks, how to transition between multiple activities, and how to handle fragmentation issues.  These were never touched on in my all-day sessions, and they&#39;re all large barriers to writing real applications.</p><p>Once I left the class I had a sense that I actually now knew enough that, with some help from web searches, I could actually write an Android app.  I just needed a good idea, so <strong>I tried to take notice of various itches in my life to see if I could scratch any with a phone app</strong>.</p>

However, due to having attended UberConf consecutively for three years, last year I&#39;d seen about half the sessions already either in previous years on at local Java User Group meetings, so I decided that this year I&#39;d try something different.</p><p>OSCON was a radical departure for me.  UberConf is a &quot;Java/Agility&quot; conference, and since I work almost exclusively with the JVM in an Agile environment, it&#39;s more or less custom-tailored to my interests.  OSCON, however, had a huge variety of different tracks and a similarly varied group of attendees.  There were Python folks, Ruby folks, hardware hackers, system admins, operations gurus, cloud nerds, data geeks, perl wonks, and more.  I picked OSCON because, while the variety was less tailored to my interests, the sheer number of tracks (18 concurrent sessions per time slot!) made up for it.</p><p>Here is my review of the OSCON experience.  OSCON was the first conference I&#39;ve been to outside of my home state, and really the first one not run by the Rocky Mountain Software Symposium.  As such, it will be unavoidable that I will be comparing it largely to my UberConf experience, since it&#39;s my only real frame of reference.  I will try to address each element of the conference separately.</p><p>First thing&#39;s first, how were the sessions?  I don&#39;t go to tech conferences to network or hand out business cards, though I hear that&#39;s half the point.  I treat conferences like an intense week of school, I take notes and try to learn as much as I can in the sessions.  A tech conference&#39;s quality is going to be 95% the quality of the sessions for me, so they&#39;re the most important thing by far.</p>

				<p>I don&#39;t post book reviews here very often.  Typically I write up a few paragraphs about a book when I finish it and post it to my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1499157-rod-hilton">Goodreads account</a>, which I consider enough of a review for nearly every book I read.</p><p>But &quot;Presentation Patterns: Techniques for Crafting Better Presentations&quot; by Neal Ford, Matthew McCullough, Nathaniel Schutta is a bit more than a book.  I&#39;m not joking when I say this book has actually changed my life.  As such, I felt it was necessary to devote an entire post to it to draw extra attention to it.</p><p>In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that I know the authors personally, sort of.  I&#39;ve had a conversation or two with Neal and Nathaniel at various developer conferences, though I seriously doubt either of them would remember or even think my face looks familiar.  McCullough I&#39;ve interacted with quite a bit more, but I once managed to get him to tell me he wanted to punch me in the face.  If you&#39;ve ever met Matthew, you&#39;d know this is pretty much like getting Gandhi to call you a stupid asshole.  The point is, I&#39;m not affiliated with the authors or getting anything out of promoting the book.  I just found it extremely valuable and wanted to share it.</p><p>In any case, Presentation Patterns is excellent.  The book is full of tons of real-world, usable tips, ranging from how to speak clearly to how to organize your thoughts to the actual mechanics of doing specific things in Keynote and Powerpoint. It&#39;s very detailed in this way, rarely leaving the reader wondering how to do a thing the book describes.  Reading this book after seeing many presentations by speakers like Ford, McCullough, and Schutta was an eye-opening experience, something akin to seeing how the sausage is made.</p>
