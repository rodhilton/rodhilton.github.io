Absolutely No Machete Juggling is a blog about software, programming, technology, and me.

I’m a software developer located in Colorado. I primarily deal with Java, though I work with a number of different programming languages, my favorite of which is Ruby. I’m always looking to learn new tools and techniques, and I hope to use this blog to share solutions to technical challenges I’ve faced, as well as stories about my life.

I’m also a PhD candidate at the University of Colorado in Denver, studying Computer Science with a focus on Theory and Algorithms.

This blog mostly focuses on my fascination with technical topics and my professional and academic life. Every so often I contemplate posting about more divisive issues such are religion and politics, but so far I’ve managed to avoid doing so.

This blog is divided into categories at the top of the page, allowing visitors to follow posts about technical issues such as programming or technology without following posts about my personal life.
