				<p>There is one type of interview question I see pretty frequently that drives me absolutely bonkers.  I&#39;ve never actually been given this queston myself, but I&#39;ve worked at a lot of companies that like to ask it (I&#39;ve been lucky).  Just recently, a friend of mine who has been interviewing mentioned some of the questions he was given; one of them fit this description and all I could do was feel bad for the poor guy.  There&#39;s no way he answered it correctly, despite being a very capable software engineer.</p><p>I refer to this question as the &quot;Career In A Bottle Question&quot;</p><p>Very often this question is actually given prior to an interview, as something you submit to a company after passing an initial phone screening but before they bring you in.  The question takes a form similar to the following:</p><p>Write a program that will <em>[anything]</em>.  Please write it as though it were going into production.</p>

				<p>Two months ago, I took a new job.  I&#39;ll write a post about the company some other time, but I do want to highlight one aspect of the company: the usage of Apple products.</p><p>I spent most of my youth in Windows, but I switched to Linux a few years back and greatly enjoyed it.  It annoyed me that I didn&#39;t know my way around Mac OS, the only remaining one of the &quot;big three&quot; with which I was not proficient.  When I took the job at Rally, I was excited to find out that they were an Apple shop.  All of the developers had powerful mac machines, the pairing stations were all iMacs, and pretty much everyone owned a Macbook or iPhone, or both.  Rally was going to be a good place to learn my way around the world of Apple, so I was excited.</p><p>To give a little background on myself, I am a bit of an open source zealot.  Even when I was a Windows user (for a while, I worked as a Flash programmer and Flash didn&#39;t run in Linux), I replaced the Windows shell with <a href="http://www.ls-universe.info/news.php">LiteStep</a>, an open source shell.  I ran open source Windows software almost exclusively - my goal was to make the Windows Kernel the only proprietary thing running on my machine.</p><p>The only Apple product I had owned up until I took the new job had been an iPod, but I replaced the iPod firmware with <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/">Rockbox</a>, which is open source.  A year ago I wanted to upgrade my iPod Nano to the newer, smaller model, but when I brought it home and tried to install Rockbox on it, I found out that the newer Nanos had some kind of protection that prevented firmware replacement.  My response was to actually return the Nano to the store and keep my old one, which I still use.</p>

				<p>Ever do something like the following?</p><p>Pretty annoying, especially considering that the output usually shows the enormous startup script commands running with Java.

				<p>Two weeks ago, I gave notice at <a href="http://www.openlogic.com">OpenLogic</a> to take a position with a new company in Boulder.</p><p>Normally, when I quit a job, people want to know why I was unhappy at my company.  And normally, I have more than enough to say in response to that question.  For the first time in my career, however, I have nothing negative to say about a company I&#39;m leaving.</p><p>OpenLogic is great.  OpenLogic is a company full of bright people and I applaud and support what they are trying to do: spread open source into enterprises.  OpenLogic&#39;s business goal was what attracted me to the company in the first place, and it still excites me today.</p><p>It&#39;s strange, because the last company I left, Acxiom, felt like breaking up with an abusive girlfriend.  She was nasty and treated me poorly (the company, not my immediate coworkers, who were great), and I was happy to dump her.  OpenLogic is more like the really nice girl that you really want to be happy, but she just isn&#39;t right for you.  The girl who you tell &quot;it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me,&quot; and actually mean it.</p>

				<p>I wanted to start experimenting with the Gnome Deskbar recently, particularly to make it easier to update my twitter feed.  There are a number of deskbar plugins for twitter updating, though most of them are obsolete because of recent changes to Deskbar.</p><p>I had a lot of trouble getting <a href="http://www.butterfat.net/wiki/Projects/DeskbarPlugins">WAYD</a> (a twitter/pownce/jaiku updater) to work with Deskbar, so I figured I&#39;d post to explain what I had to do to make it work.</p><p>First, when you download the plugin, you need to put it in the correct directory.  A lot of instructions tell you to place the file in <code>~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/handlers</code> but these instructions are for older style plugins.  You want to place the file in <code>~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/modules-2.20-compatible</code></p><p>Next, you need to rename the file.  The file is named to have a version number in the filename after a dash.  Dashes aren&#39;t allowed in python filenames, so rename <code>wayd-1.4.py</code> to <code>wayd.py</code></p>

				<p>This is a story about dealing with a Colorado realtor, Blue Sage Realty.  Blue Sage Realty employees were rude and awful to deal with, and actually kicked us out of the leasing office when we asked for an in-writing solution to the problem of a nonfunctional air conditioner.  In short, this story has been posted as a warning to anyone else: do not deal with Blue Sage realty.  They will make you miserable.</p><p>My fiancee and I were looking for houses to rent in Colorado and found one that looked like a good size in our price range, so we scheduled a viewing with Blue Sage Realty in Colorado, the management company for the property.  When my fiancee and I showed up to the place to look around, the kitchen floor had just been cleaned, and the fridge had been pulled out of the kitchen, blocking the doorway.  We were unable to see the kitchen or anything that could only be reached by walking through the kitchen, meaning we were unable to see the kitchen, the dining room, the garage, the porch, or the back yard.</p><p>Despite being unable to see half the house, we loved it, and sent an application (and a check) within an hour of leaving.  Our credit was checked (we have great credit), our current landlord was called (we&#39;ve been great tenants), and we were approved for the house within a day.</p><p>Johleen Belliston, a Blue Sage Realty employee, told us we were approved and we should come in to sign the lease.  We explained that we had not yet seen the entire unit, and she warned us that if we didn&#39;t act fast that we might lose the house to another renter.  Worried, we scheduled another showing as soon as we could.</p>

				<p>In Java, when you call the <code>toString()</code> method of an object that hasn&#39;t overridden it, it prints out strings that look like these:</p><p>Many people believe that this is the memory location of the object, but it&#39;s not quite.  It is, however, a string that <em>seems</em> unique to an object, so the confusion seems understandable.</p><p>A friend recently asked me if there was any way to get that &quot;address&quot; on an object that has overridden <code>toString</code>.  Once <code>toString</code> has been overridden, calling it will bypass this default implementation.  Since his internet search didn&#39;t pull anything up, I figured I&#39;d do some research and blog about the answer to his conundrum in case anyone else is ever curious about it.</p><p>It may be surprising, but calling the default <code>hashCode()</code> actually gives you this value.  The <code>hashCode</code> method doesn&#39;t hash the actual object by it&#39;s value, but by it&#39;s identity, meaning this is the reference ID.</p>

				<p>Since my current job switched everything off of Java to Ruby and Rails a while back, I was concerned that my Java skills may get rusty.  I had wanted to pursue another Sun Certification anyway, so I decided to take the <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/scjd.xml">Sun Certified Java Developer</a> exam.</p><p>This exam was very different from the other two exams I had taken, in that I did not need to study or answer any questions.  I did not have to go into a room and answer randomly chosen multiple choice questions.  Instead, I was given a document that called for an application to be written with specific functionality, and I had to then write that application and submit it for review.</p><p>The test consisted of two parts: the first was writing the application and submitting.  The second was taking an essay exam in which I had to explain my design choices.  The second half was largely to ensure I did not pay someone else to write my project for me.</p><p>The project definition itself was very odd.  It was essentially an application to manage hotel reservations.  All of the projects required some kind of networking component between client and server (I used RMI), and all of them forced you to deal with some locking and concurrency issues.</p>

				<p>Recently at work I had a bizarre problem to deal with.  Essentially, we are distributing an application that uses <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>, and we were encountering a problem whenever people would use our application in Windows if they installed Java in a specific way.</p><p>A lot of Windows users install Java not by putting the bits on disk and setting JAVA_HOME, but by adding java.exe to their path.  When done this way, Java works in the sense that you can type &quot;java&quot; in a command prompt and have it understand what that means.  You can compile java from command line and run it with no problem.</p><p>The problem we experienced was that JRuby, in windows, specifically looks to see if JAVA_HOME is set.  If it is not set, the JRuby executable bails.  I submitted a <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2301">patch</a> to JRuby to fix this behavior, but we could not rely on that solution until it was integrated.</p><p>What we are doing now is, in the batch file that we have that calls our application, we look to see if JAVA<em>HOME is set and, if it is not, step through the PATH looking for java.exe.  We then set JAVA</em>HOME based on the location.  As a result, by the time the JRuby script runs, JAVA_HOME has been set.</p>
