				<p>I wanted to start experimenting with the Gnome Deskbar recently, particularly to make it easier to update my twitter feed.  There are a number of deskbar plugins for twitter updating, though most of them are obsolete because of recent changes to Deskbar.</p><p>I had a lot of trouble getting <a href="http://www.butterfat.net/wiki/Projects/DeskbarPlugins">WAYD</a> (a twitter/pownce/jaiku updater) to work with Deskbar, so I figured I&#39;d post to explain what I had to do to make it work.</p><p>First, when you download the plugin, you need to put it in the correct directory.  A lot of instructions tell you to place the file in <code>~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/handlers</code> but these instructions are for older style plugins.  You want to place the file in <code>~/.gnome2/deskbar-applet/modules-2.20-compatible</code></p><p>Next, you need to rename the file.  The file is named to have a version number in the filename after a dash.  Dashes aren&#39;t allowed in python filenames, so rename <code>wayd-1.4.py</code> to <code>wayd.py</code></p>

				<p>This is a story about dealing with a Colorado realtor, Blue Sage Realty.  Blue Sage Realty employees were rude and awful to deal with, and actually kicked us out of the leasing office when we asked for an in-writing solution to the problem of a nonfunctional air conditioner.  In short, this story has been posted as a warning to anyone else: do not deal with Blue Sage realty.  They will make you miserable.</p><p>My fiancee and I were looking for houses to rent in Colorado and found one that looked like a good size in our price range, so we scheduled a viewing with Blue Sage Realty in Colorado, the management company for the property.  When my fiancee and I showed up to the place to look around, the kitchen floor had just been cleaned, and the fridge had been pulled out of the kitchen, blocking the doorway.  We were unable to see the kitchen or anything that could only be reached by walking through the kitchen, meaning we were unable to see the kitchen, the dining room, the garage, the porch, or the back yard.</p><p>Despite being unable to see half the house, we loved it, and sent an application (and a check) within an hour of leaving.  Our credit was checked (we have great credit), our current landlord was called (we&#39;ve been great tenants), and we were approved for the house within a day.</p><p>Johleen Belliston, a Blue Sage Realty employee, told us we were approved and we should come in to sign the lease.  We explained that we had not yet seen the entire unit, and she warned us that if we didn&#39;t act fast that we might lose the house to another renter.  Worried, we scheduled another showing as soon as we could.</p>

				<p>In Java, when you call the <code>toString()</code> method of an object that hasn&#39;t overridden it, it prints out strings that look like these:</p><p>Many people believe that this is the memory location of the object, but it&#39;s not quite.  It is, however, a string that <em>seems</em> unique to an object, so the confusion seems understandable.</p><p>A friend recently asked me if there was any way to get that &quot;address&quot; on an object that has overridden <code>toString</code>.  Once <code>toString</code> has been overridden, calling it will bypass this default implementation.  Since his internet search didn&#39;t pull anything up, I figured I&#39;d do some research and blog about the answer to his conundrum in case anyone else is ever curious about it.</p><p>It may be surprising, but calling the default <code>hashCode()</code> actually gives you this value.  The <code>hashCode</code> method doesn&#39;t hash the actual object by it&#39;s value, but by it&#39;s identity, meaning this is the reference ID.</p>

				<p>Since my current job switched everything off of Java to Ruby and Rails a while back, I was concerned that my Java skills may get rusty.  I had wanted to pursue another Sun Certification anyway, so I decided to take the <a href="http://www.sun.com/training/certification/java/scjd.xml">Sun Certified Java Developer</a> exam.</p><p>This exam was very different from the other two exams I had taken, in that I did not need to study or answer any questions.  I did not have to go into a room and answer randomly chosen multiple choice questions.  Instead, I was given a document that called for an application to be written with specific functionality, and I had to then write that application and submit it for review.</p><p>The test consisted of two parts: the first was writing the application and submitting.  The second was taking an essay exam in which I had to explain my design choices.  The second half was largely to ensure I did not pay someone else to write my project for me.</p><p>The project definition itself was very odd.  It was essentially an application to manage hotel reservations.  All of the projects required some kind of networking component between client and server (I used RMI), and all of them forced you to deal with some locking and concurrency issues.</p>

				<p>Recently at work I had a bizarre problem to deal with.  Essentially, we are distributing an application that uses <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a>, and we were encountering a problem whenever people would use our application in Windows if they installed Java in a specific way.</p><p>A lot of Windows users install Java not by putting the bits on disk and setting JAVA_HOME, but by adding java.exe to their path.  When done this way, Java works in the sense that you can type &quot;java&quot; in a command prompt and have it understand what that means.  You can compile java from command line and run it with no problem.</p><p>The problem we experienced was that JRuby, in windows, specifically looks to see if JAVA_HOME is set.  If it is not set, the JRuby executable bails.  I submitted a <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-2301">patch</a> to JRuby to fix this behavior, but we could not rely on that solution until it was integrated.</p><p>What we are doing now is, in the batch file that we have that calls our application, we look to see if JAVA<em>HOME is set and, if it is not, step through the PATH looking for java.exe.  We then set JAVA</em>HOME based on the location.  As a result, by the time the JRuby script runs, JAVA_HOME has been set.</p>

				<p>It&#39;s quite easy to have multiple versions of rails installed as gems when working with ruby on rails.  Quite frequently, you will be working on a project that uses an older version of rails than one on your machine, and all you have to do to get the correct version is:</p><p>Multiple versions of rails can exist independently on your machine without much of a problem.  Since your individual rails projects store the version number they expect, and your projects don&#39;t tend to depend on each other, you can have hundreds of different rails versions installed and never notice. Mostly.</p><p>If, however, you wish to start a NEW project, when you run</p><p>It will use the most recent version of rails.  But what if, for some reason, you have rails 2.0.1 and rails 1.2.6 on your machine, and wish to generate a rails 1.2.6 application?  This came up because I&#39;m trying to teach a friend rails, and the book he has is for rails 1.2, meaning that if he uses 2.0 all of the scaffolding code (as well as other bits) from the book are incorrect.  At the same time, the application he and I are working on together uses rails 2.0, so he needs both versions on his machine.</p>

				<p>One of the nicest things about Ruby is how well it supports metaprogramming.  You can dynamically, at runtime, change the behavior of any other class or module in the system, even private methods.  </p><p>When I was first learning Ruby, this seemed like a flaw, and while I still feel that this ability can be abused, it is definitely handy.</p><p>I&#39;m going to explain a simple method of changing the behavior of part of Rails by a real-life example from work.</p><p>For a Ruby on Rails project I&#39;m currently working on, we had a somewhat uncommon requirement.  We&#39;re dealing with a lot of data, which we store for other companies.  For various reasons, one of the concerns is that we may be subpoenaed and forced to provide all of our records for legal reasons.  In order to fully protect the identities of our customers, our system was designed around never actually storing any identifying information about our customers.  Instead, customers get a special code that identifies them, and we only have the ability to know the code, but we can&#39;t tie the code to any specific organization.  This may seem like a strange restriction, but for our application it was important.</p>

				<p>I&#39;m going to show you a little trick that will add two methods to any Java class, without actually defining them.  Furthermore, these methods will be given package visibility, accessible by any class in the same package. </p><p>First and foremost, credit for showing me this interesting <code>javac</code> tidbit goes to <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/">Ted Neward</a>.  Ted recently presented an introduction to java bytecode at a local JUG.  The entire presentation was incredibly interesting, but one of the more interesting bits that came out was a little bit of trickery the java compiler performs in certain cases.</p><p>Let&#39;s take a look at two classes.   One we&#39;ll call CompTest, which will be a simple class that contains a private String and a method to print it to the screen.  The second will be CompExecutive, which will simply make a CompTest instance and call the one method it defines.  It will also use Java reflection to count the number of methods on CompTest.</p><p>When we run this program, we get what we would expect.  The outputted string, as well as the number of methods defined in CompTest, one.</p>

				<p>For the past two months, I&#39;ve been learning three different programming languages simultaneously.  I&#39;ve been wanting to learn Python for a while, and I finally made some time to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Second-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596002815">Learning Python</a> cover to cover on camping trips.  I&#39;ve also been thrown into the world of Ruby (as well as Rails) for work, since we are developing our next web application using that technology.  Lastly, I&#39;ve had to learn C# and .NET for school - the last class for my Master&#39;s degree.  </p><p>I&#39;ve wanted to learn all three of these technologies for a while, but I&#39;ve never had the time.  This has been a very exciting experience for me, and I wanted to share my first impressions of these languages.</p><p>I&#39;ve been working with C# less than the other languages, so I still have a great deal to learn.  Overall, the experience has been pretty positive.  The language is almost exactly like Java.  Java stole it&#39;s syntax from C for the most part (for developer familiarity), but C# is sort of a syntactic hybrid between Java and C++ (more towards the Java side).  Overall, I like it.  </p><p>I used to use C++ in high school and C in college.  I never really liked C++ - I felt like the language hacked object orientation onto a fully procedural language, and it really showed.  The language never seemed well designed to me, and it kind of had a &quot;worst of both worlds&quot; feel to it.  C# seems like a natural progression in the C family - something even higher level than C++, without the procedural vestiges of C.</p>
