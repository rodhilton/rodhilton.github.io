				<p>I do not belong to the cult of iPod.  I use a nonstandard mp3 player and I hate iTunes.  If I&#39;m going to use an mp3 player, it needs to show up as a USB drive on my Linux workstation, my Windows desktop, and my Mac laptop.  I need to be able to drag files over and be done with it.  So far, I&#39;ve been successful at accomplishing this.</p><p>But the simplicity comes with a price.  I cannot download books from <a href="http://www.audible.com">Audible.com</a> and put them on my player to listen to them.  I have to convert all of the files I download from Audible into DRM-free mp3 files.  There are lots of ways to do this, and even software tools that will do this automatically, but <strong>all of them just play the file in iTunes and capture the audio stream to a file</strong>.  I want something completely digital, which can run in the background without me having to worry about my operating system making other sounds that interfere with the result.</p><p>I have developed an alternative to this method, which lets you convert your Audible audio book downloads to DRM-free mp3s in just a few minutes, with a very small amount of manual work.</p><p>On Audible.com, find the book you want and download it.  Make sure that it downloads using the Audible Download Manager and results in you getting .aa files for the book.  If Audible tries to make you download something else, you may have to add a new device on Audible.com.  Pick something simple (not an iPod) and select &#39;Format 4&#39; for the desired type.</p>

				<p>Change is inevitable in the world of software.  In fact, the need for change and the related need to adapt to change are the driving forces behind the agile movement.  Requests for change generally come in one of two main forms: enhancements and defects.  A defect means &quot;the software isn&#39;t working the way it says it will&quot;, whereas an enhancement basically means &quot;the software isn&#39;t working the way the customer wants.&quot;</p><p>The basic cycle of modern software development looks like this:</p><p>It&#39;s step 4 that generates change requests.  The customer says that something isn&#39;t working the way they want it to be working, and the cycle repeats.</p><p>Very often, you will hear developers whine about enhancements that are being filed as defects.  Product owners will often respond by saying that it doesn&#39;t matter, it all has to be fixed.  A common phrase I hear is &quot;they are all defects from the customer&#39;s perspective.&quot;  This mentality is echoed in <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer">Practices of an Agile Developer</a>.  The attitude is generally, defects and enhancements are basically the same thing, it&#39;s all work that needs to be done, and programmers are being pedantic when they insist on making the distinction.</p>

				<p>The book essentially covers two topics. The first topic is how your brain works. This is interesting, to be sure, but the book really shines when it comes to the second topic: how to use your brain, knowing how it works.</p><p>Andy talks about very light cognitive science, and he puts it into extremely digestible terms. I never felt lost, but I never felt patronized either. I emerged from reading the book with a far better understanding of the brain in an academic sense.</p><p>But more importantly, I understand exactly what the limitations of my brain are. I understand what my brain is good at, and what it is not so good at. I understand why I think of programming solutions in the shower. I understand what makes the difference between retaining what I read and not.</p><p>This book is essentially a toolkit for electro-shocking your brain. It teaches you how to nurture the creative parts of your brain, and how best to utilize the differences between the different aspects of your mind. It teaches you how to manage your focus on different tasks and how to avoid incorrect and biased thinking. <strong>In short, it teaches you how to use your brain the way it&#39;s truly meant to be used.</strong></p>

				<p>Everyone knows the drill with Agile: the developers put estimates on stories, and those estimates are used to plan releases.  Of course, some releases go awry, with the engineering team delivering far fewer completed stories than expected.  When this happens, people start to ask &quot;why are our estimates so inaccurate?&quot;  What many don&#39;t realize, however, is that this is the wrong question.  Estimates don&#39;t need to be accurate, they need to be consistent.</p><p>Our velocity corrects for the inaccuracy of our estimates.  As long as engineers are consistently wrong, the velocity will ensure that releases can be planned and executed smoothly.  If releases start to become increasingly bumpy and unpredictable over time, there&#39;s a good chance that your consistency is to blame.  Poor consistency means rocky, less predictable releases, which in turn can lead to incurring technical debt in order to meet release commitments.</p><p>Here are five things to watch out for within your team.  These are inhibitors to consistency that typically will plague a seasoned agile team, not a new team transitioning into agile.</p><p>Estimates on stories are meant to be relative to other estimates on stories.  Whenever engineers think of an estimate, they need to be comparing the story to other stories in the past in order to evaluate consistently.</p>

				<p>I love RSS feeds.  I love the fact that I live in a time where the vast majority of sites that I find interesting have managed to export their data, updated live, in a universal format that I can pull together in a single place.  I can read what&#39;s going on with hundreds of sites I care about by visiting a single site like Google Reader, or through a single piece of software or a browser plugin.  It&#39;s great.</p><p>But this comes with a downside.  I have almost 200 subscriptions in my Google Reader account.  Many of these subscriptions are to sites, such as <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> or <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, that themselves, aggregate other sites.  I have divided my Google Reader subscriptions along various categorical tags (such as politics, development, movies, etc) as well as priority tags (Must Read, Should Read, Can Read, Can Ignore, and Should Ignore) but even that isn&#39;t quite enough to manage the firehose of information coming my way via RSS.</p><p>I have utilized <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com">Yahoo Pipes</a> to manage this deluge of information and I thought I&#39;d take some time to share how.  This article will serve both as a basic tutorial for using Yahoo Pipes to manage your RSS feeds as well as a place to show some specific examples I use to control my feeds that you can use as well if you subscribe to the same sites I do.</p><p>Yahoo Pipes, if you&#39;ve never used it, is simultaneously both intimidating and insulting the first time you use it.  You drag components around on a screen and connect them together with little paths.  It feels like you&#39;re programming in Visio or something.  Yet, even though you feel like a child dragging components around, you find yourself simultaneously overwhelmed by the number of components that exist in the system.  Yahoo Pipes is tough to get used to.</p>

				<p>In the comments for my <a href="/2009/02/19/book-review-the-art-of-agile-development/">review of &quot;The Art of Agile Development&quot;</a> an old colleague asked me a few questions about Pair-Programming, one of the key tenets of XP (which the book advocates).  My response so was so long and detailed that I felt it deserved it&#39;s own post.</p><p>My current job is the first one where I&#39;ve ever pair-programmed.  I actually recall interviewing for it, and I was asked if I had pair-programmed before.  I said sure, occasionally I would pull another developer over to my desk to help me and we&#39;d sit together to figure it out.  This apparently was a decent enough answer to the question that I got the job, but now that I&#39;ve been pair-programming nearly full-time for five months, I&#39;ve determined that what I was doing before was definitely not real pair-programming.</p><p>When I first heard I&#39;d be pairing at the new job, I was a bit apprehensive and skeptical.  Do I really have to sit next to some fat developer all day, 40 hours a week?  When am I going to check my RSS feeds?  What if the other developer is gassy or hasn&#39;t showered?  How am I going to listen to my totally awesome Death Metal if I can&#39;t wear headphones?  Will the other developer be constantly judging and correcting my code?  <strong>Will pairing prevent me from hitting &quot;the zone&quot; where I&#39;m just belting code out so fast that my fingers can&#39;t keep up with my brain?</strong></p><p>Over the last five months, I&#39;ve found answers to all of these questions: &quot;no,&quot; &quot;often,&quot; &quot;that&#39;s rough,&quot; &quot;easily,&quot; &quot;sort of,&quot; and <strong>&quot;YES, but that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;</strong></p>

				<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675/">The Art of Agile Development</a>&quot; by James Shore and Shane Warden is a book that is primarily focused on explaining Agile to people who want to adopt Agile software development practices for their team.  The bulk of book is divided into sections based on a categorization on agile practices.  There is a chapter on practices that help with thinking, one for collaborating, one for releasing, one for planning, and one for developing.  In each of these chapters, there are sections devoted to a specific practice, such as &quot;pair programming&quot;.  The sections describe how to do the specific practice, what benefits it offers, what challenges you might face when adopting the practice, and so on.  Usually it also has some frequently asked questions about the practice (with answers, of course) and some suggestions for alternatives if you have a reason to not adopt the practice.</p><p>First and foremost, I need to mention my biggest criticism of the book.  It has one of the most misleading titles I have ever seen.  This is <em>NOT</em> a book on Agile.  It is a book on XP, one of a few different flavors of Agile.  The correct title for this book is &quot;<strong>The Art of Agile Development using XP</strong>.&quot;  This is worth mentioning for a few reasons.  First of all, XP&#39;s practices are pretty hardcore.  XP&#39;s engineering practices are all extremely useful, but most of the time when a company or team resists Agile, it&#39;s because they are resisting a typically XP practice, such as Test-Driven Development or Pair Programming.  Personally, I&#39;m a big fan of XP&#39;s practices, but the fact of the matter is that any team that wishes to become Agile will likely find the most resistance if they try to adopt XP, so it seems misleading to sell the book as an introduction to Agile when it is, in fact, an introduction to XP.</p><p>That said, this is an excellent book on XP.  All of XP&#39;s practices are covered in just the right amount of detail - giving you enough information that you can adopt the practice, but requiring that you do additional research about the ones that interest or challenge you the most.  This allows the book to be a pretty quick read in general, which is beneficial for a team wishing to adopt XP practices soon.  This level of detail does have one disadvantage, though: by staying largely in the realm of hypotheticals and ideals, I often found myself thinking that the authors were being naive and idealistic about how easy some practices were to adopt.  This made me somewhat more skeptical of the book than I would have been if more detail had been offered, but ultimately I felt the level of detail was right; I did my own research online about some of the things that challenged me.</p><p>One of the most annoying aspects of the book are the &quot;examples&quot; that are sometimes provided.  Usually these examples provide a sample conversation between stakeholders as they illustrate the effectiveness of an XP practice.  These little micro-plays are so exaggerated that it often felt like reading the script to a bad company training video.  After a few, I found myself skipping them.</p>

				<p>There is one type of interview question I see pretty frequently that drives me absolutely bonkers.  I&#39;ve never actually been given this queston myself, but I&#39;ve worked at a lot of companies that like to ask it (I&#39;ve been lucky).  Just recently, a friend of mine who has been interviewing mentioned some of the questions he was given; one of them fit this description and all I could do was feel bad for the poor guy.  There&#39;s no way he answered it correctly, despite being a very capable software engineer.</p><p>I refer to this question as the &quot;Career In A Bottle Question&quot;</p><p>Very often this question is actually given prior to an interview, as something you submit to a company after passing an initial phone screening but before they bring you in.  The question takes a form similar to the following:</p><p>Write a program that will <em>[anything]</em>.  Please write it as though it were going into production.</p>
